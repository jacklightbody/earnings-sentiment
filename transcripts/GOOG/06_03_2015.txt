Dr. Eric Schmidt
Thank you, and good morning to all of you for our Annual Shareholder Meeting. We’re so happy to have you guys here. And I hope you all enjoyed our breakfast. I am going to be presiding over the meeting. And everybody here should be registered, if not just make sure that people know who you are and you got your badges and so forth. And everybody should have an agenda and on the agenda is a list of rules and procedure on how we actually do this meeting. So at this time, I would like to call the meeting to order.
I wanted to mention we’ve got a number of executives and Board members in the room, in particular we have a number of Board members, I see John Hennessy over here, I see Ann Mather, obviously I see our CEO and Founder Larry Page. Let’s see who else I see. David Drummond this year, who will be speaking right after me, Patrick Pichette is here. Where is Patrick? There he is, Patrick standing. And Patrick, as you know, foolishly decided to retire to pursue rest of his life. And his contribution to this company to working for myself, for the Board with Larry obviously is hard to describe. And the contribution that he has made in terms of shareholder value for all of us has been fantastic. So, thank you very much Patrick. Fortunately Patrick is such a good Canadian that he decided to find an even better replacement for himself in Ruth Porat who is also here. And she is in the process of tuning with Patrick which must be really rather extraordinary and you will be taking over instantaneously as I think roughly. So Ruth is here as well.
So, the way we’re going to do this -- sorry, I want to introduce a couple of more things. Mora Stanley, [ph] where is Mora. She is over here and she is a representative of Computershare, our transferring agent who will also be our inspector of elections and Barbara Machin, [ph] Alice [ph] and Tera Murphy [ph] where are they? They are over here and they are representatives E&Y, Ernst & Young, who’ve been our very long time independent accountants.
Now every year I get a chance to say something nice about David and this year I feel like saying even nicer things about David. David was the executive who signed the incorporation papers of this corporation and he now runs an awful lot of very interesting investments, programs, legal issues, business programs, global issues, public policy and God knows what. David, please join us.
David Drummond
Thanks Eric. And welcome everyone to the 2015 Annual Stockholders Meeting. I think this is number 11 or so for me and for the first time I’m tieless. So, I figured I’d stick with the Silicon Valley tradition this year.
So, we have normal set of the business in terms of electing directors and so forth and a number of stockholder proposals. So, a quick note about the logistics for today. As stated in the rules, stockholders shouldn’t address the meeting unless you are recognized. We will provide a Q&A session after the formal part of the business -- the formal part of the meeting, so you’ll have a chance to ask some questions. If you want to ask a question during that period, we’ve got I believe we’ve got some microphones in the isles, so you can move to those microphone stands; please identify yourself once you’re recognized, state that you’re a stockholder or you’re representing a stockholder, then go forward with your question. So thanks for your cooperation with the rules and let’s move forward.

So, I’ve received the affidavits of mailing from Computershare which states that the notice of the meeting was duly given. All stockholders of class A or class B common stock as of the close of business of April 6th, 2015 are entitled to vote today. In addition, I’ve been advised by the inspector of elections that holders of our outstanding class A and class B common stock representing at least a majority of the voting power of those classes of stock are entitled to vote. A majority is represented here in person or by proxy. So therefore a quorum is present and the meeting is duly constituted and we can go forward.
First item is the election of directors. We have 11 directors to be elected at today’s meeting and the directors elected today will hold office until next year’s annual meeting of stockholders. We have the following nominees, Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Eric Schmidt, John Doerr, Diane Greene, John Hennessy, Ann Mather, Alan Mulally, Paul Otellini, Ram Shriram, and Shirley Tilghman.
Now our byelaws require that stockholders provide advanced notice of their intent to nominate persons as directors. We haven’t received any such notice, so accordingly I declare nominations for directors closed.
Now, the next matter for us to look at today is the ratification of the appointment by the board of directors of Ernst and Young as our independent registered public accounting firm. Our Board has recommended that our stockholders ratify this appointment for the 2015 fiscal year.
The next matter being submitted is the approval of an amendment to our 2012 stock plan to increase the number of the -- maximum number of shares of our Class C capital stock that may be issued under this plan from 30 million shares to 47 million shares. Our Board of Directors has recommended that our stockholders approved this and that’s described in detail in our proxy statement.
Now the next five items to be presented today are all stockholder proposals. Our Board of Directors, you should know, has recommended unanimously that our stockholders vote against all five of these proposals that will be presented today. Now, the first stockholder proposal is being brought by Mr. John Chevedden, Mr. James McRitchie and the NorthStar Asset Management Funded Pension Plan, as the co-lead filers, and Sonen Capital as a co-filer. I believe we have Ms. Abigail Shaw, here is she, of NorthStar Asset Management and she’ll be presenting the proposal. Ms. Shaw, you have three minutes.
Abigail Shaw
Good morning. My name is Abigail Shaw from NorthStar Asset Management in Boston, the beneficial owner of over $2.6 million of Google common stock. As Google shareholders know, Google has three classes of stock, Class A with one vote per share, Class C with zero votes per share and Class B with an overwhelming 10 votes per share which is closely held by management insiders. This discrepancy hands over a super majority of control of the firm to insiders, essentially making it impossible for stockholders to weigh in. Yet the concern we raise here is not just about fairness, we are also concerned that insiders and management seek to insulate the governance of the firm from shareholder oversight.
Studies have shown that excessive voting control given to insiders leads to poor performance over the long term. In fact a study has reported that the more control that the insiders have, the more they can pursue strategies that are at the expense of outside shareholders. Studies have also shown that on average and over time, companies with multiclass capital structures underperform those with a one share one vote standard in which owner’s economic risk is commensurate with voting power.
In a world where our company’s primary purpose is to expand access to information and knowledge in an open and democratic way, limiting substantial shareholder input is wildly counterintuitive. We feel that shareholder value is best derived when insider voting control of the firm is separated from insider economic ownership. Economic ownership provides enough of a reward for management when stock prices rise. The current tri-class structure eliminates shareholder checks and balances over management decisions. Without a tally of one vote per share claiming that stockholders accepted or rejected a proposal means little more than that Mr. Page, Mr. Brin and Mr. Schmidt voted for or against it.

We are very concerned that over the long term the use of insider control at Google will inhibit shareholders from weighing in on company governance and policy issues with detrimental effect on shareholder value over the long-term. We urge you to vote for proxy item number four. Thank you.
David Drummond
Thank you very much, Ms. Shaw. We have the second stockholder proposal which is being brought by Walden Asset Management, as the lead filer and is joined by a number of other organizations including Sonen Capital. We have Ms. Danielle Ginach of Sonen Capital, who will be presenting this proposal, there she is. Ms. Ginach, you have three minutes.
Danielle Ginach
Thank you and good morning. My name is Danielle Ginach of Sonen Capital, representing Walden Asset Management, the primary sponsor of this proposal. Together, we own over 115,000 shares of Google. On behalf of Sonen, Walden and approximately 30 additional co-filers including the state of Connecticut pension fund, I’m pleased to move resolution number five seeking information on how Google directly and indirectly works to effect legislation and public policy. This request for transparency has been made to hundreds of companies, many of which have proactively adopted policy in favor of more robust lobbying transparency, indicating acknowledgement of this as a best practice. Google has spent over 63 million in federal lobbying in the last five years, ranking one of the top five companies in lobbying spending over the last two years. While Google has taken steps towards disclosure, this revolution requires expanded disclosure of where this lobbying dollars go.
While Google discloses a summary of direct federal lobbying on the website, there is incomplete disclosure about spending at the state level. We’re obtaining comprehensive lobbying information as described by an expert is “nearly impossible, given the presenting manner in which data is captured and made available online”, effectively burying this information at the state level. Google lobby is extensively at the state level with what has been described as “an army of lobbyist from coast-to-coast to protect its emerging technologies from new rules and restrictions.” To make these activities more transparent and accessible, we recommend that Google provide a summary of dollars spent quarterly as well as the major issues that it’s actively lobbied in favor at both the state and federal levels. Google also does not disclose meaningful details beyond the names of over 100 trade and advocacy organizations they’re in support of, how they value exterior lobbying positions or even the size of contributions made.
These disclosures are absolutely necessary in order to evaluate Google’s role in trying to affect legislation and regulation. We do want to congratulate Google for the company’s public decision to withdraw from ALEC, a known climate denying group actively working to combat renewable energy standards at the state level. Google acted on its stated values when it withdrew from ALEC. An action we enthusiastically commend. However there are other trade associations whose actions conflicted Google’s values. For example, Google is an active member of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a group that has spent a billion dollars on lobbying since 1998, which has already sued the EPA and plans to sue them again this summer, once EPA formulates its new regulations addressing climate change.
Clearly that’s -- it creates an outright conflicts with our stated environmental position to address, limit and mitigate the effect of climate change. As a logical expression of stated policies, we ask that Google join Apple, Microsoft and others in speaking out to proactively distance the company form the Chambers actions which impede responsible climate policy as well as ask that you join other companies in publicly endorsing necessary forward looking legislation.

Our company is a national leader in so many positive social and environmental values that deserve to be reflected in how our lobbying dollars are spent. This resolution is calling for disclosure and transparency around lobbying, it’s an important step that strengthens Google’s mantra of corporate responsibility and objective to do no evil. My colleague Will Morgan will second the resolution. Thank you.
David Drummond
Thank you very much. Ms. Ginach. We have the third proposal which is being brought by the Firefighters’ Pension System of the City of Kansas City, Missouri. Maureen O’Brien of the Marco Consulting Group will be presenting this proposal.
Maureen O’Brien
Thank you. Good morning. My name is Maureen O’Brien and I’m here to present the proposal on behalf of the Firefighters’ Pension System of the City of Kansas City, Missouri, Trust. This proposal is very straight forward. What we’re asking for is the majority vote standard when directors are elected to our board. As everybody here knows the role of the board is to protect our investment by overseeing management and we have the right to elect those directors every year at this meeting. The problem at Google is that the company uses a plurality vote standard. So, if one person votes for a director that persons is going to get elected because for the most part these elections aren’t contested; there is let’s say the number of nominees match the number of seats for the board.
So, what we’re asking for is the majority vote standard, all that means is that to get a seat on the Google board more than 50% of shareholders or shares voted would have to support that candidate. We think this is a pretty straight forward, common sense policy, many companies use this; many companies in our sector use it including Amazon.com, Microsoft and Yahoo. So for a company that’s a leader in so many other areas, we think you should use this best practice standard in corporate governance and adapt to a majority vote standard. So please support our proposal. Thank you.
David Drummond
Thank you very much, Ms. O’Brien. The fourth stockholder proposal is being brought by Mr. Shelton Ehrlich as the lead filer. Hello, Mr. Ehrlich, who is a frequent visitor to the Annual Meeting, so great to have you here again? The mic is yours for three minutes.
Shelton Ehrlich
Thanks. I do come every year and criticize proposals like that brought by Walden. They think that the Chamber of Commerce does evil; they don’t take protect us against lots of bad legislation by lobbying and thank you Google for being a supporter. So, this year I decided I’d submit a proposal.
This proposal asks that management tell Google shareholders if their investments in renewables makes economic sense. Management says its goal is a 100% renewable like electricity, but they don’t explain why this is in the best interest of Google’s owners, that’s us. We ask management to compare buying power from the local power suppliers as you and I do, with Google’s investments in renewable but intermittent sources of electricity. What do I mean by intermittent? If you drove over the outer mount [ph] Pass at about 7:30, to get here on time, you’d had noticed that ocean of wind mills sitting still, not paying their way. In fact on average that wind farm only works 25% of the time and kills almost 5,000 birds every year. Talk about protecting the environment, wind sucks.
Google tells us in the proxy, why you should vote no on my proposal. Because they’ve already provided all the information you’d need on this topic. But then they turn around and tell me, if they give the information, it would hurt Google’s competitive position in negotiating for power, which is? We’ve already got everything we need, or they dare not give it to us. It’s not true that preparing the requested report would affect company’s competitive position. We asked for an aggregate analysis, not data center by data center. How many dollars were spent and how many kilowatts did those dollars buy and how much do we pay for each kilowatt hour and how much would we have paid if we bought the power from the local utility, just as you and I do, when we buy power for our homes and businesses. And by the way, I wondered how much does the government kick in.

I started my career in energy about 60 years ago, and worked on making it, saving it, moving it and with a few others invented the main method for converting biomass into electricity used in California. I’ll bet a few photons from these lights are coming from the biomass energy this morning. Please vote yes on this proposal, so we can find out if Google is spending our dollars wisely. Thank you.
David Drummond
Thanks very much, Mr. Ehrlich. So, the fifth and final stockholder proposal is being brought by the National Center for Public Policy Research. Mr. Justin Danhof, there he is, will be presenting the proposal. You have the floor to three minutes.
Justin Danhof
Thanks Mr. Drummond. My name is Justin Danhof, I’m General Counsel with the National Center for Public Policy Research and I rise today to move our proposal that seeks greater transparency concerning Google’s alternative energy projects.
I agree with a lot of what Mr. Ehrlich said that current disclosures really don’t give investors the full picture of what’s going on. Because it’s no secret that the federal government and many state and local governments offer substantial tax rates and lavish grants and loans for renewable energy projects, Google has taken advantage of those tax payer subsidies. So, our proposal asks managements to tell us shareholders one simple thing, if renewable energy projects such as solar and wind were forced to compete in an actual free market, would Google investors be at risk. If politicians in Washington, Sacramento and elsewhere change their minds about spending hundreds of billions of tax payer dollars on green energy projects of private businesses like ours, what would the impact be on our shareholders?
The company has claimed that it supports to debate regarding energy policies, but as long as the company accepts grants and loans, based on the belief that global warming is significantly caused by humans, and it is a severe problem, the company has a clear conflict of interest. If the company promotes the global warming theory, it promotes policies that enhance the company’s coffers. But if the company promotes any skepticism whatsoever, it risks undermining support for grants and loans for green energy projects, management has already begun. So, the company’s desire to continue grants and loans for green energy appears to be undermining our management’s admirable reputation as straight shooters. In choosing, we believe on wisely to withdraw from the free market, American Legislative Exchange Council, known as ALEC. Chairman Schmidt said ALEC was, "literally lying" about climate change. But ALEC has no position on the degree to which climate change is occurring whatsoever and what the causes might be. ALEC simply promotes policies that reduce government interference with energy markets. Since ALEC has no position at all, its position can’t be a lie. Mr. Schmidt was being dishonest and the proponent of proposal five is simply lying to you.
Schmidt’s over the top statement, which by the way could unnecessarily make the company vulnerable to a lawsuit by ALEC, implies that Google is highly emotional about the climate change issue, which in turn raises the possibility that the company is very reliant on energy policies that provide lavish subsidies for renewable energy projects. If this is so, don’t shareholders deserve to know the extent of the company’s exposure? American tax payers heavily subsidize renewable energy projects. These subsidies are not permanent. We have legitimate concerns that potential changes in government policies on alternative energy may harm the company’s investors. If you want to know the risk that Google is taking with your investment, please vote for our proposal. Thank you.

David Drummond
Thanks Mr. Danhof. So that concludes the presentation of the stockholder proposals. And because no further business is scheduled to come before the meeting, we’re going to open the polls.
Now, if you’ve previously voted by proxy, you don’t need to vote here today, unless you want to change your vote. Now, it’s important to tell you that we’ve received sufficient proxies before the meeting to know that all the proposals discussed today will either pass or fail in accordance with the recommendations that were made our Board of Directors that are described in the proxy statement. However, we want to make sure that everyone gets a chance to vote. And if you want to vote and you requested a ballot when you registered, please complete that now. We’ll give you a moment to fill that out if you haven’t and if you could raise your hand and -- so we have some folks who can collect your ballot if you need them to.
Anyone else have a ballot that needs to be collected? There is one in the back, one here. Okay, it looks like we’ve got all the ballots collected. So, I can declare the polls closed. So, here are the results. I’ve been advised by the inspector of elections that the nominees for the election to the Board of Directors have been duly elected. I’m also advised that a majority of the shares of our Class A and Class B common stock that were entitled to vote and that were present here today, voted in favor of the ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young to act as our independent registered public accounting firm for the 2015 fiscal year as well as the approval of an amendment to our 2012 stock plan. So therefore each of these proposals has been approved by our stockholders.
I’ve also been advised that the majority of the shares of our Class A and Class B common stock again entitled to vote and present here today, have actually voted against the stockholder proposal regarding equal shareholder voting. The stockholder proposal regarding the lobbying report, the stockholder proposal regarding the adaption of majority of vote standard for our election of directors and the stockholder proposal regarding renewable energy cost and finally against the stockholder proposal regarding the report on the business risk related to climate change regulation. So, therefore each of these stockholder proposals has not been approved by the stockholders.
As soon as possible, after the meeting, probably in the next few days, we’ll complete the final vote tabulations and we’ll provide that final result of the final vote on our investor relations website and in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
So that ends the formal portion of the meeting. And so this part is adjourned. And Eric will make some remarks. So, I’ll turn it back over to Eric. I do have to read some fine prints and let you know that the remarks, presentations, product demos and answers to questions that you might ask, contain forward-looking statements about Google’s business outlook and other matters, so actual results of course and outcomes for these matters may differ from these forward-looking statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties. Those risks of course are described in great detail in our public filings with the SEC.
Dr. Eric Schmidt
Thank you all. And it’s great -- this is a big day here and I am really happy that you all have come and I actually enjoy the debate and enjoy the questions. So I have a number of comments I wanted to make from my perspective as the company, I’ve had the pleasure of being here for more than 14 years.
What is the impulse, what is the sort of heart that beats at Google at sort of trying to do these things? And I’m thinking about it and I’ve decided that it is really about asking hard questions and therefore searching for better answers to those sort of hard questions. And search can be understood as our first product; it’s a metaphor that we think about invention, take something that matters in people’s lives and find the better way to do it. And as everybody here knows, Larry and Sergey were at Stanford doing whatever graduate students do and they were wandering around doing search. And the answers that they were getting were just not very good and so the two of them as part of their graduate work, actually invented the new algorithm for organizing information. It’s an example because they had a unique technical insight; they didn’t do it the way the other folks did and that started this entire process.

And of course once you’ve solved it, you’re not done. It sounds like they invented the solution; they invented the 0.1% solution of something that was far grander vision around organizing information. So it’s interesting if you fast forward a couple of years, in 2000, Jennifer -- J. Lo., Jennifer Lopez wore a beautiful green dress and everybody was excited about this particular dress. We’re searching for it and there was no way for us to surface this. So, a set of engineers said, maybe we could do a product which today is known as Google Image Search which could actually index and find these and boom, a whole new category of billions and billions of queries today in that regard. It’s also interesting that around the same time people said, holy cow, people don’t just speak English in the world and people started -- like a shocked. So all of the sudden people started thinking, what are we going to do about translation because at that time the majority of the web was all English and the Google Translate was born which now today has more than 1 billion free translations everyday in 80 different languages; and by the way it does it without a dictionary which is what I think is extraordinary.
We did the same thing with maps. People would query [indiscernible] and all of a sudden they wouldn’t get the right map. So people figured out, we built a map of the whole world and we did it satellite picture driving and all that together. What’s interesting is now mobile is important, everybody here has the problem. But if you are like me and you have big fat fingers, it’s sort of hard to type Voice Search was inspired by the fact that people said there is going to be a lot of mobile, people want to talk and all of a sudden Voice Search again done without a dictionary, again it’s magic; it’s an example of innovation.
And so when I hear people say search is a solved problem, they clearly don’t understand the gap between what people really want and what is technologically possible today and that gap is what Google try and seeks to close. So let me give you an example. Show me flights under $500 for places where it’s hot in December and I can snorkel. Perfectly reasonable query; try that query, you are not going to get the perfect answer yet. Now it turns out it’s interesting that Google actually knows about flights under $500; we know about hot destinations in winter; we know the places near the water and we know cool fish to see and what Google doesn’t know -- by the way I don’t snorkel anymore, but this is a separate discussion. So, the fact of the matter is that we’re getting close to the answer to being able to answer those kinds of conversational questions which from my perspective is search is the holy grail.
But think about how cool that would be. And what I would argue is that with all of the proliferation of devices, the ability to navigate through all of this, whether it’s on your phone or on your computer or whatever, voice and text and so forth is really part of our future. And we had a similar idea around Google Play. Basically when you buy something at Google Play and you are reading a document or watching a movie, whenever you switch to a different document, all of a sudden there you are it’s seamless from the standpoint of a normal person.
Now, this is a great vision in my view and I think everybody agrees, if you are one of the couple of billion that’s connected. But what about the 5 billion that are not, what about them? They are human beings just like us and we’re going to serve them as well. One day one of the teams that Sergey was leading actually came in and said we have an idea to put a balloon that would use height and width in the stratosphere to navigate, to move around to provide 4G telephony service. And I made a bet that it would never work. I was so convinced that this idea was audacious. And of course the team not only made it work but it’s now operational in the southern hemisphere. This is extraordinary; this is an extraordinary stuff; it’s a true invention, something, even many, many people I knew thought that you couldn’t do to telephony from balloons up from that altitude. It shows you the passion and the ideas of basically people who just see a different world and they work here.

So you sit there and you think about rural students in Brazil or rural people in New Zealand who never had access to telephony level on the internet and now they get it and they get it in an affordable prices, working with the local Telco. So, if you start to follow this model of the core mission where we put most of our money, our mantra is if you do something useful, everything else follows.
So, we don’t start from the position of, oh here is a business plan and here is a large market, what we try to identify is here a problem that has to get solved, that has to get solved in an interesting way. And we do this, think about ads and the democratization of ad service and now even large firms and small firms.
And I remember when I first came here, there’s this huge debate as whether the big advertisers would get preference over the little advertisers. And Larry and Sergey took the position I think quite rightly that it’s a market and everyone stands on his or her own economics and we’ll let the market and the auction work out and of course that would ultimately change the world. It’s interesting; so when we define what we’re trying to do our goal is to build for the entire world, not just for the rich people; not just for the developed world; not just for any particular group. So you think of our market, it’s not that 2 plus billion people that are using smartphones and on the web or rather the 7 billion, or so that are our ultimate target market. You see how far we have to go and how much larger the enterprise and our mission can evolve, especially if you include all the other things that we’re focusing on.
It’s interesting, I was in a meeting yesterday with the Governor of California, Governor Brown and he used the quote, “let’s be unreasonable, but in an intelligent way”. And I liked that. Let’s ask for things which are unreasonable but let’s do it in a clever way. So, you sit there and you go okay, okay I got it, I got this search thing, I got the ads thing, what about self driving cars and healthcare and all the other things that we’ve begun to invest in, although the majority of our investment is obviously in the first stuff that I talked about. And our strategy is to focus on things which are not just relevant now but for the next generation.
Most companies in my observation, having done this for a long time, ultimately fail because they do one thing very well but they don’t anticipate the next thing; they don’t broaden their mission; they don’t challenge themselves; they don’t continually build on that platform for sort of a greater impact of one kind or another. And what they do is they end up being incrementalists and Google is very committed to not doing that. Because we want -- we understand the technological change is revolution -- is essentially revolutionary, not evolutionary.
So, an engineering team led by very, very smart doctor had the idea of doing, we could a read diabetic’s blood from tears using a contact lens. Do you think that matters? If you assume that one third of Americans are going to be diabetic by the end of our lives, which is roughly the current projection, it matters a lot. And that team, a very small team built the world’s smallest battery with this extraordinary engineering thing is now licensed to a large pharmaceutical that’s busy trying to productize that.
What about car accidents? Everybody here has been touched by some sort of car tragedy. 1.2 million people are killed in traffic accidents every year, that’s like a 737 crash every day, right, and yet we accept this. How is this possible? 93% of these crashes are caused by human error. We are very, very close to having cars that really can drive without operator intervention. And I’m convinced that 100 years from now when our successors, children, grandchildren, whatever are sitting there watching the movies and they’re going to see some handsome young actor in an old movie get in the car and start driving it, they’re all going to giggle and they’re going to say, you let that guy drive a car? What a dangerous concept, it makes no sense; computer should do this better and they don’t drink and all those sorts of things. So, in this context, what are sort of the big bets in computing? And let me say this for computer science in general of course, Google being a leader.

Clearly Android, majority of market share and iOS from Apple, think of it as the powerful supercomputer in your hand, billions and billions of times better than the mainframes of old that I grew up on. Think about the fast networks that we’re building. I’d like to think of it as one broadband, fast 4G network and the fiber that we and others are installing around the world. Google scale cloud computing; Google has very, very powerful offerings in this area and of course that some of our platforms are built on, infinitely expandable with large data sets and so forth and of course just the web revolution, the web is not -- so the app revolution, the web is not dead, but apps are taking a lot of our attention. And so moving from think of it is from search just making suggestions right, from saying this is a good idea or that is a good idea. And I think one of the wow value moments, now I stood literally on the stage as we introduced Google Earth, almost a decade ago and I remember of telling the story that my wow moment for Google was the day I realized that from the safety of my office right over there, I could traverse the top of Mount Everest right from the safety of my -- to me that was a wow moment because I knew I never have the courage to actually do that kind of stuff.
So, what’s a wow moment now? Let me tell you one. A wow moment is the day you realize that you depend so much on your phone, you are likely so integrated in your phone; a day -- the day that you put your whole genome into the cloud and we’re beginning to enable this with partners and researches can use it to help map the cancer genome and help others in a profound way. The day that you realize that you are alive because a computer saved you, think of airbags on automatic cars. The day that you have a 3D image projected to you of your grandson, and we’re close to being able to do that sort of thing. The day that you can see a blind man, who can now see, because of a retinal implant and what he said to me was, I can now see with my eyes closed. You want to know what’s important; that’s what’s important.
Google is working on all of this technology in one way or another. And so when I think about the future and I’ll finish it up by saying, I’m really convinced that computer science and the platforms that we are all building on will be changed by machine learning. Google is a major player in machine learning. Technically what we do is we take layers of networks and we build up information. When you use Google image search and you look for tags, if you look at our photo product that we announced last week, which appears to be the most profound change in photo and photo organization in the history of large scale photos and photo organization. And the reviews have been fantastic; it uses these kinds of techniques to figure out to the degree possible what’s inside these pictures. And these algorithms take -- in some sense if you take a lot of data, you train it and you produce the new program. And that’s the magic of this new machine learning model. And it works particularly well for very large datasets. So, if you have lots of data which Google in fact has, whether it’s search data or location data or picture data or so forth, large training sets, you really can make things that make your life that much more powerful.
So, a possible future is you could imagine a world where the computer helps suggest what you could do or what you should learn today. You could send me a summary of something, but you could make me smarter on something that I know about. And the most extra ordinary thing about that is that applies to every one of the 7 billion people on the planet. That’s what’s I’m proud about. This is not some luxury product for an elite that these techniques and algorithms will really make everyone in the world that much smarter. And the smarter world in my view is one of the greatest goals for our future.

So, when I sort of put this together and I say what is Google about, I think it’s asking difficult questions and searching for these better answers. We start from first principles; I gave you a series of examples. We built something that’s very useful right; it’s got flaws and so on, but we know it’s very useful, that maybe people didn’t even know that they needed, but it changes their lives. We aspire to serve everyone. Remember I said it’s not a 2 billion-person audience; it’s a 7 billion and growing audience. And we have a healthy disregard in my view for the impossible. We are not perfect; we make mistakes, but let me tell you of that when the ideas work, they change the world.
I stand here today as I have in the past and as David and Larry and other are to tell you that the company that you have placed your trust in has so many opportunities ahead of it. We are just at the beginning of the possibility of the technological transformation of the kinds of things that I’m talking about. This trust that you have given us is -- I hope, you agree is not misplaced. With your help that we are really committed to improving lives on a truly massive, massive global scale. This would not be possible without your belief in us. And I really look forward to a successful future together with all of you. Thank you so much.
We are going to -- I think we have a video and then I’m going to ask David and Larry to join me.

Dr. Eric Schmidt
While we’re coming up, I’d like to mention that Diane Greene, also Board member is here. Welcome Diane. Where’s Sergey? Sergey is in the corner.
And I think people know Sergey. It’s hard to describe what an extraordinary joy it is for me to work with Larry and Sergey. If you ever have an opportunity to work with people who have such a vision and such a sense of what they can accomplish, it’s a life changing experience. So, thank you Larry, thank you Sergey for founding all of this.
I think what we’ll do is we’ll just -- I guess we’ll just start with questions. We have microphones here in this one, on any subject who would like, and we would like you to use the microphone. And I think since we have Reverend Jessie Jackson [ph] here, maybe Reverend you could start with comments, questions and take your time.
Question-and-Answer Session
Q - Unidentified Analyst
Mr. Schmidt, thanks to you and to David and Larry and Sergey for opportunity to present to you today in the LMPL [ph] traditional conference. We want to be the conscious of the valley, to make the valley just, more fair and more inclusive. I spoke to you last year about the need to open up a new era of inclusion for women, Afro-American, Latinos and other people of color in Silicon Valley’s technology industry. Those who are left out represent money, market, talent, occasion and growth. The untapped genius of America’s unfinished business is inclusion which is our moral deficit. Of what the difference that you make, disrupted the text phase and placed racial diversity, gender equality and inclusion of the forefront of the industry’s agenda.
We’ve challenged continents to discard the old model of exclusion, is unsustainable and that will continue to push Google and the rest of Silicon Valley and the tech industry. To transform the leadership teams, supplier base, workforce and business partners who look like America. You’ve argued the business case with Black and Latino communities and the women represent underserved markets, unutilized talent and untapped capital. The Google and the tech industry will do well to embrace, engage and empower this basic creativity and innovation, you cannot afford not to. Advanced leaders across the country will disrupt the tech industry with a vision, commitment and courage to help usher in a new era of diversity and inclusion beyond holding a progressive diversity strategy including a $150 million and spent for 2015, your program through the endeared engineers at Harvard and Hampton and other HPCUs, is a great step forward. 37% of black engineers come from those HPCU schools; we can’t stop that. Google has built tech labs to turn on our youth and holding and building apps. We’ll organize with your support a thousand churches, we’ll build tech labs and the churches to teach kids financial literacy, stock market, game, apps and so we can reduce 100,000 every six months with your support. These huge under schooled departments with empty space weeks of the time can be a big asset to you and all of us.

Google is stepping up and Intel and other and they’re $300 million university initiative is stepping up, Apple is stepping up. They are all uniquely positioned to lead this new era. But despite being selfless and embracing all yesterday’s USA to date. Representation of Afro-Americans and Latinos remain basically static. Too many technology companies have zero or too few women or people of color in the board rooms and see suits and then the work force. The company cannot look like a snow tab mountain, white up top and black and brown at the bottom. And so that they would [indiscernible] in an open called to come to us to again release year one, the diverse data that you have by September 1 and provide a one year report on the progress they’ve made on diversity and inclusion. It’s time to think they -- think about Google’s creating the driverless cars and beaming Internet connectivity to peripheral drones in the sky.
If you put your minds to it, you can certainly build a pipeline to engage Afro-Americans, Latinos and people of color to change the face of technology. You have demonstrated that you can solve the most challenging complex problems in the world, including the commonly faced problem. If we put our collective minds to it we can solve that too and I’ll pose a few questions Eric in closing.
When I commend Google for fulfilling the commitment you made last year of releasing an [indiscernible] report and diverse the data to the second straight year, thank you for that. You’re putting new initiatives and programs into place but you’ve not moved a needle on representation very much. What are the challenges that you face and what can we do to work with you to achieve that purpose. Two, will Google make a commitment to including the Blacks and Latinos on your board of directors, but it is by expansion or attribution, specifically we’ve good reason to consider governance bylaw amendment require an explicit and active search for women and people of color for all board openings.
Through Google recruitment has over 35 billion parked overseas. Did you consider repatriating some of this offshore money back to America, the front end innovation in investment development bank and in return receive tax credits like reduced tax rate on foreign profits. And lastly, will consider making a major investment to form the early Black and Latino [indiscernible] startups. I thank you again what opportunity to speak to you today, let’s make Silicon Valley look like America inclusion leads to growth and when there is growth, everybody wins. Thank you very much.
Dr. Eric Schmidt
Thank you Reverend Jackson [ph] and thank you for the things that you try to do to make our country a great country. How would you guys -- there is a set of questions; I’d like to answer all of them if we can.
David Drummond
I think we all probably have comments. I’d just start up by saying thank you Reverend Jackson for being here. And I’ll just start off by saying we are at a stockholders meeting and inclusion, diversity, making sure that our businesses look the way our country, our world look is an incredibly important thing to do from human rights standpoint, so the right thing to do. We’re here at a stockholders meeting. And I can tell you and reiterate that Google’s view that this is an incredibly important business issue, to drive stockholder value one of the things we need to do is to get all the talent and include all of the talent at Google and reach out to all the talent and that’s we’re very committed to doing that.
We did release the numbers last year; we committed to continuing to have that level of transparency; we released some this year. And quite frankly they didn’t show in terms of the percentages a big movement. We had an uptick on the number of women in our technology by a percentage point which was actually significant because we have 55,000 plus people; moving percentage points takes a lot. So we feel there was a little bit -- some progress there, not nearly enough. With Blacks and Latinos, I can tell you that while the numbers didn’t move, the number of Blacks and Latinos at Google is rising at a rate greater than the company as a whole. So in terms of the weight, we’re increasing that. But this is a long struggle and we know that we’ve got to keep working on this, working on a hard. We want to continue to work with Rainbow/PUSH other groups. The thing you could do is continue to push us and we welcome the pressure and we’re going to continue to put pressure on ourselves to do better.

Unidentified Analyst
The reason I raise this David and Eric, we’ve just gone to the [indiscernible] Baltimore. And here is the case where your 18,000 [indiscernible] homes or abandoned lots. The banks use subprime lending and drove them in the whole, they got bear other people locked up and desperate. Unemployment 37% [indiscernible] don’t live in the city. Result is you have these patches of dry grass and only a match can light it and the whole nation is riveted by it. There must be some creative plan to induce, to incentivize because the resources, the tip money and tech companies and the bank and the prime equity money is on the one side of town. We just let newer guests who had a tech meeting with the mayor and the workers university yesterday. In [indiscernible] 44,000 people work there every day but 18,000 live there; those who live there don’t have transportation who are the jobs off.
I am not convinced [indiscernible] will solve this. I think it is in our own interest because those markets are in the posh zone, those markets represent untapped market, money, talent, location growth and security. And some foreign markets are less lucrative than undeveloped markets of home and that’s appeal we are trying to make.
Dr. Eric Schmidt
And to answer couple of other parts of your question just real briefly, on the Board question, we have a strong statement in our nominating process; it requires us to seek out broad diversity. Let me note that we have three of our eight independent directors are female and this continues to be unsolved but important problem. I will pass your recommendation on John Hennessy is here; he’s the Chairman of the Nominating Committee, for further discussion. And on the tax question and the repatriation [ph] question, there are many good reasons to get the money that’s currently trapped overseas into America, to invest in America, but we’ve not been able to move the political conversation on that for many reasons.
Unidentified Analyst
Maybe we should do it together, I wonder if you can talk with [indiscernible] and Ms. Warren [ph]. There is several trillion dollars overseas. And there must be some incentive way to bring much of the money back for America in the reconstruction and we want to be a part of working out a plan that when you enlighten interest to bring a portion of it back and the government has role the to play relative to tax security.
Dr. Eric Schmidt
Thank you very much, Reverend. [Ph] Yes, sir?
John Simpson
My name is John Simpson, I am a shareholder and for the full disclosure, I am also the Privacy Project Director for Consumer Watchdog. I have two questions, both of them relate to your robot cars or driverless cars or autonomous vehicles, call them what you will. First question, when legislation authorizing driverless cars on public roads was making its way through the California legislation, Google re-bussed an amendment that would have protected privacy, they are requiring that data gathered by robot car could be used only for operating a vehicle and not for such things as marketing. Would you be willing to protect driverless car use as privacy in the future and commit today to using the information gathered by driverless cars only for operating a vehicle and not other purposes such as marketing without a knock in that used by the vehicle’s operator?
Larry Page
I think it’s pretty early in the game with driverless cars and the uses that they could be put to the benefit users, to be drawing -- to have a lot of rules say, thou you shall not do X, Y and Z with the data. I think once we get these operational, the value could be significant. And I think that it’s a reasonable thing for regulators to look into the uses of data that are developed in driverless cars just like any other activity. So, I think we took position; it’s a little early to be making, drawing all those kinds of conclusions which would in a lot of ways reduce innovation and our ability to deliver a great consumer product at the end of the day.

John Simpson
Thank you. Second question, after Consumer Watchdog learned through a public records act request that accident reports involving driverless cars can in fact be filed with the Department of Motor Vehicles, Google acknowledged your robot cars have been involved in 11 accidents since testing began. The DMV considers the accident reports confidential. A Google’s spokesman called the crash is minor and said Google’s cars weren’t at fault. That’s what any driver says when they are in an accident, it wasn’t my fault. But we have to take your word for it, and don’t really know what happened because Google hasn’t released the actual accident reports, which you could do. Will you release reports, so the public knows what went wrong, and will you commit to making all future accident reports public?
Dr. Eric Schmidt
Sergey, do you want take it. Sergey is in-charge of this project, so. [Multiple speakers] I’m actually quite surprised that you are a shareholder. Consumer Watchdog has been quite hostile to Google, puzzled by that.
John Simpson
Well, we think that it’s important as a public interest group that we speak out on issues that companies are involved in effect of public interest. You’re driving your vehicles and testing them on public roads; is it in public interest and what you’re and when it goes right that’s wonderful and when it goes wrong, we want to know why?
Dr. Eric Schmidt
No, I think that’s all fair; I’m just surprised you’re shareholder, but.
John Simpson
Why wouldn’t I’d be? Then I get to come and speak and ask you questions, it was like made money on this investment which was all good. And soon I’d be taking my tie off and I’ll fit right into Silicon Valley, maybe I’ll do that right now?
Dr. Eric Schmidt
Sergey, why don’t you go ahead and answer his questions?
Sergey Brin
Yes, I can tell you all about the accidents. We submitted reports to the DMV which was what the legislation though was the best course of action. There are about seven or eight times we were rear-ended. Actually if you want to know, we recently in the past week, we got rear-ended again while been stopped at a light. And there were a couple of times, once I think actually once when one of our drivers was driving the car and accidently rear-ended somebody. And I guess our biggest learning from the accidents has been that people don’t pay attention even trained drivers. The one time when I was -- our driver at fault was many years ago and we’ve since had a lot of training for our drivers. You’re interested in the accident reports. I mean I can tell you -- I should note also -- I can’t remember the other three or so but there were situations when the car was not driving itself there and we were hit, I forgot -- like stoplight somebody around at and we were side swiped, a few things of that nature.
I am very proud of the record of our cars. And by the way, we don’t claim that cars are going to be perfect. Our goal is to beat human drivers and nothing can be a perfect vehicle. So I just want to set that expectation. I am very pleased that we’ve done as well as we have and I think because we have really good safety protocols and really good safety drivers.
To your question about the DMV reports, the DMV wished us to submit those reports to them in the private matter. If we were to disclose them, I can tell what they say, I mean they say so and so Mr. John Smith, rear-end of the car and such an intersection; we don’t want to release those details of those because that is a privacy issue. They mentioned --.
John Simpson
You mean the person’s name --.
Sergey Brin
The person’s name, the car make and model things like that.
John Simpson
I could see redacting a person’s name but I mean the details --.
Sergey Brin
That’s true, but I can tell you what the rest -- I can tell you what the forum looks like. It is the details of person A, person B who is the Google safety driver and then it’s a description which we write what happened, like we got rear-ended. I mean it’s basically the summary we’ve already given you. I suppose we could give more detail and we’re open to that but you’re not going to learn anymore. I mean it is though, you’re saying you’re taking our word for it. We have many responsibilities to be truthful to the press, in our statements to the DMV and so forth, that’s not going to change. But the reports are asking for basically, say what we have already summarized plus private information on individuals; there is nothing else in them.

Dr. Eric Schmidt
So, maybe you could finish and we need to move to our next question.
John Simpson
Thank you very much.
Dr. Eric Schmidt
Thank you, Sergey. 31,000 people are killed on American highways every year; anything we can do to reduce that is a life saved. Yes, ma’am.
Danielle Ginach
Hi. My name is Danielle Ginach from Sonen Capital. I have a quick comment just specifically building on to Reverend Jackson’s comments and thank you so much for those. I just wanted to actually commend the board specifically on its diversity. Clearly there is more work to be done throughout the organization. But as investors dedicated to investing in those companies that show leadership on social and environmental best practices, we wanted to call attention to Google’s actions and leadership.
So investors are aware that these issues have increased and come under increasing scrutiny over the last few years, regarding composition and diversity of board, leading investors such as Larry thinks the CEO of BlackRock where investors have spoken out saying that these really need to be -- we need to see improving female and I think representation of board on the 30% collision and other group comprising investors, policy makers and NGOs are all actively pressuring companies with zero or limited board diversity to make an urging commitment to increasing this diversity and adopting its standard. And I think as the Reverends comments stated, this is kind of getting beyond the right thing to do and something that shows increased performance from a financial standpoint, instances of decreased corruption, decreased fraud; so it’s something we’re very pleased to see as shareholders. So, I wanted to make a comment commending the board and commending Google for showing leadership in that area.
Dr. Eric Schmidt
Thank you very much, and the way back?
Abigail Shaw
Good morning. My name is Abigail Shaw from NorthStar Asset Management in Boston. I’d like to take this opportunity to commend Google for its good work on and commitment to renewable energy. The final two shareholder proposals on today’s docket seem to disagree but what is quickly becoming a fundamental truth. Action in favor of the environment is good business. The New York Times recently wrote that a clean energy is catching up with conventional energy in terms of cost, reporting that the cost of utility scaled solar energy is as low as $0.056 a kilowatt hour and wind is as well as $0.014. In comparison, natural gas comes at $0.061 a kilowatt hour on the low end and coal at $0.066. To give you context, the average price for electricity in U.S. is about $0.12 per kilowatt hour.
In choosing clean energy solutions for company power usage and through investment in companies like SolarCity, not only does Google take important steps forward for the environment by reducing the company’s reliance on fossil fuel based energy, but it also keeps the financial bottom line in mind.
Further supporting climate change policy is a smart way to safeguard the company’s investments. As clean energy becomes more popular, more easily dispatchable and decreases in cost on a wide -- on a more widespread scale as innovations continue, Google can be at the forefront of this financial and environmental movement. Google clearly understands the importance of committing to cleaner our energy. It is both good for business and good for the future of our world. Thank you.
Dr. Eric Schmidt
Okay. Thank you very much. The gentleman in the back?
Larry Page
Thank you. I just want to say we have not only an investment in SolarCity, but a deal with them to fund residential installations, but everything else is correct I think.

Good morning. Question for Larry, we’ve learned recently about the forthcoming Android Pay, we learned -- I think it was in April about the fact that Google Wallet funds were going to be or are FDIC insured. Just curious about your views about the future of financial service, the next generation of financial services, what regulatory hurdles you see as it relates to the strategic plans with Google?

Larry Page
We have been working on payments on phones for longtime and it’s something we’ve been excited about. So, I’ve been paying for a while with my phone, just Google Wallet and now Android Pay. I think it’s pretty great experience, I mean people -- we didn’t show it in the video, but it could have been in the video. First time you pay with the phone and you don’t have to pull out your card and mess with entering codes and signing things and so on. It’s pretty great experience. We’re so excited about that I think we’ve made a great announcement in Idaho last week. We’re in partnership with many different financial institutions and banks and so on. But I think primarily just getting that amazing experience for a payment becomes something you don’t have to mess around with, it becomes really easy is a big deal and we are really excited about that.
Dr. Eric Schmidt
Yes ma’am?

My name is Suzan Cosco [ph], I have essential familial tremor. So, I must thank you for the eating tool. I would like it have a knife piece. I attended electric by rate cuts, while last year and he had just been hired by you at the age of 64 to hedge your AI as I understood it and I wanted if you had any comments on that?
Larry Page
In general, I think on the scenario I have talked a little bit about machine learning and how can make many -- it also made many of our products much better. I think we think this is a very important area. It has been quite amazing I think what computers have been able to do in translation and search and understanding photos, which we just released this week, last week as well. And so I think were at the quite the early stages of that in terms of empowering everyone in the world to get things that they wanted to do, done, by using computers to do a lot of that work. And Ray is certainly great speaker on this topic and great thinker. We have many other people in the company as well, who are hard at work on those things. And I’m very excited about that.
Unidentified Analyst
Good. Thank you. Just one thing for you Eric. I lived by something I heard Dr. Land say. He said he invented the polaroid camera because he went out with this little girl one day and took a photograph and she said let me see it daddy and he said you can’t see it and he went home and invented the polaroid camera. So, asking the question is the big deal. Thank you.
Dr. Eric Schmidt
Thank you so much. The gentlemen in the back.

Hi. My name is Eugene Chow [ph], I went to undergrad at Berkeley. I just graduated from law school at Berkeley, studying for the bar, decided to take a day off to come down because I’ve been be a shareholder since undergrad and never made to a shareholder meeting. So --.
Dr. Eric Schmidt
So, welcome.
Unidentified Analyst
Yes. Thank you. But going to law school has really made me -- it’s taught me a healthy fear of the future. And basically I think that’s my undergrad days when I bought Google shares, which was around the time of the IPO. So as a shrewd investor I invested at the apex of the price right after the IPO. And when I think about that it’s because there is a real sense of imagination I think; there was and it’s something I don’t have any more because of law school.[multiple speakers] And the bar is not really getting me in that mood anymore. But when I think about like an undergrad, the sort of the imagination what Google is going to do. I also grew up with a lot of dystopian Sci-fi movies, the worst of which is off course is Wall-E and in Wall-E there is this future imagined where everybody are super obese and they’re sitting in chairs all day and they’re looking at screens, they’re not talking to anybody. And I think about Google in sense of you know organizing the world’s information. However to me it’s also its reaching into all these other areas, not just organizing the existing information, but finding information and creating it and sort of dataizing and informationizing it.

And so, I’m wondering like, from a philosophical point of view, when is Google’s mission done and what would that look like; will it be Wall-E or Matrix or something horrible like that or you know, I’d like to believe in the sort of the awesome videos like Google Glass and stuff, but I was wondering what you -- if you’ve ever sat down and thought you know, at the end of the day like 50 years, 100 years, a 1,000 years in the future, what will Google have created?
Larry Page
That’s quite a question. Actually just the last, the sequence of Tomorrowland which is a science fiction, Disney movie that’s trying to portray future positively and fails both, I guess the critical response has not been very good. So I think there is a problem and the reason I wanted the movie is that I was interested in a version of the future that would be positive because that’s so seldom portrayed in a science fiction and in the movies or whatever. I guess, I came away from that and said it’s not a very good story because it’s not dark. And there is a real bias, and I think there’s a real bias for us, it’s much easier to focus on the negative. I mean you know what -- stroke of fear, all things that could go wrong with something you don’t know what it is yet. So I think, it’s very hard to find positive views of the future in general. And I think that’s been true for a long time. So, don’t let that get you down. Any measure you make of the world, it’s getting better. Property, empowerment, all the issues that Reverend Jackson talked about, everything is getting better in general and by quite a bit. So I think we should be optimists and be excited about all the things that we’re building and contributing to the world because I think generally it’s working.
Dr. Eric Schmidt
We’ve run over, but I want to make sure we get a few follow up questions. Yes sir, go ahead.
Shelton Ehrlich
Shelton Ehrlich. Some of the things you described today, you’re in competition with Apple. So, I’d like to know how you compare yourself with Apple in some of those aspects. But first I’d like to say something about shareholder proposals. One of their proposals today I commended you for getting out of ALEC. And in the proxy statement, it was described as an organization that writes model legislation, as if ALEC were the only one. I’m part of an organization that has 100,000 volunteer regulation writers. If you look up and see the sprinkler system, if you see the TV and the electricity we’ve got, ones they’re both part of something called a National Fire Protection Association. I worked on model legislation for 20 years; mine dealt with boiler explosions. There are lots of organizations that prepare, what we have to call model legislation than aren’t in politics. So my question is where do you stand with -- against Apple in some of these ventures?
Dr. Eric Schmidt
My description is pretty simple. Apple is both a partner and a competitor. Apple and Google today have a huge business around search which is very important for both companies. We also compete in the toughest competition I think that there’s ever been in the computer industry, which is in the mobile phones space. And through incredible improvement that you’re seeing in smartphones in terms of capability, apps and so forth, in my view are result of that brutal capitalistic competition which is driven prices down. I can’t speak for Apple obviously, but I can tell you that over the next year, we have profoundly better versions at every price point from every manufacturer including something very strategic, something called Android One, which we’re pushing down sub $100 phones for the developing world which really does achieve the objective that we’ve set out of total inclusiveness from the standpoint of accessed information. Yes sir, let’s move it along. Thank you.

Dan Gluesenkamp
Hi, I’m Dan Gluesenkamp, I’m the Executive Director of the California Native Plant Society. For 50 years, we’ve been trying to understand and organize to some degree the most chaotic and disorganized data set, one of the most disorganized data sets on earth, the biodiversity of California; it’s a biodiversity hotspot, millions of years of evolution and environmental conditions, tools chemicals all included in the DNA of the organisms that live here.
So, our mission is to primarily protect that and then to do that we need to understand it. And so, I wanted to just ask for more assistance on that and there is a couple of avenues. One, we have a tremendous opportunity, biodiversity conservation is an enterprise right for disruption, using stone age techniques and really a lot of the difficult challenges we face are entirely soluble, they are just not soluble like grassroots, people working with abacuses. And Rebecca Moore has helped us a lot and is a great representative for Google and we need more investment in that.
And then secondly, there are some unintended consequences of actions that by looking at biodiversity conservation which is really closely aligned with what you guys are doing, it’s about data to a large degree, you can avoid some. The BrightSource project at Ivanpah led just some great destruction of some real nice biodiversity resources and ultimately did not produce too much electricity. So these large scale industrial energy developments in the desert and elsewhere, I would encourage you to work more closely on distributed solar on rooftops than these large inefficient subsidy based ones.
And then secondly, we have some things coming around the pipe; this is my last comment. I like the self-driving cars, hold the possibility that people will be able to live for there from their workplace and enjoy a shorter commute over longer distances while they get work done. And the danger there for folks like me, folks who care about conserving the truly wild places is that there will be development pressure on those for folks who would like to live up in Sierra and commute down to their job and --.
Dr. Eric Schmidt
There is an old rule that commuting, commutes average 30 minutes independent of any other fact; it’s been scientifically proven.
Dan Gluesenkamp
And my request there --.
Dr. Eric Schmidt
Let’s finish up your question.
Dan Gluesenkamp
Absolutely. The solution to that is to analyze our conservation priorities in California, collect data, figure out where the high biodiversity hotspots are, put together conservation plans for that. To fund that we could use a vehicle license fee for self driving vehicles; five bucks each would produce and have a tremendous fund to do that work, develop the information for actively conservative places, I’d like you consider.
Sergey Brin
Thank you for your suggestion. Google has funded a very large set of biologic analysis tools including genetic databases now for flora and fauna which I helped introduce a month ago; we’re very, very proud of our contribution in understanding the nature of life at a botanical level and that’s a first start along the path that you described.
Dan Gluesenkamp
We’re very thankful for the tools you gave us.
Unidentified Analyst
First of all, I really wanted to thank you for all the great stuff you are doing. And my question is are ad blockers and how you see that affecting your revenue source because that’s the primary -- Google’s primary revenue. And maybe a little bit broader as how it’s -- it seems like the ad based model is wonderful for the internet in allowing great ideas to go forward. And if you see that changing or what do you see happening there?
Larry Page
We’ve been dealing with ad blocking for a long time. There has been a number of different products and so on to do that. So I think part of it is the industry needs to get better producing ads that are less annoying and that are quicker to load and all these things. And I think we do a better job of that as an industry. And we’ve been trained as pioneers of that. I think search ads are very good in that sense. And in fact a lot of places where ads get blocked, search ads do not get blocked because they are actually useful. So, I think a really good example of what we’re trying to do, but I don’t think there is been any measure change in that dynamic over the last year or anything like that.

Dr. Eric Schmidt
Gentleman in the back will have the second last question and madam you will have the honor of the last question. So, gentleman?
Unidentified Analyst
May name is James Vancallis [ph] I’m from Southern California. I got really excited years ago when Google first came on the market, this business about do no evil, with the technical education I have I thought, wow, maybe a technical guy can even have a heart and do good things in his soul. So as I was flying up here, I was asking myself why am I going and what is my mind doing. And I thought well, it drove something in that I think might be in concert with if I had the privilege of working here, I would like to work on. I would like to see a product, app or musical or movie called Muslim hug and it just cuts right into what I think is a struggle between Sunnis and Shiites and if we could all understand that and like a Muslim ideal, like I look over my children and I go to the market and somebody is wearing a head scarf I shouldn’t have those feelings. I don’t know if a spiritual improvement product can be affected through technology but if anybody can do it, my company can do it.

I don’t know how easy it will be to develop the spiritual improvement product. But going to the examples you’ve used to of Muslim Shiites, Sunnis, one of things and obviously this is a topic of great -- there is a lot of conflict going on in the world between Muslims, between the Muslim world and west and so forth. There are a lot of -- one of the things we’ve been working on is to look at our platforms, things like YouTube and make them more available to people as a way of developing more dialogue. When there is negative speech, when there is hateful speech, when there is speech that is promoting hurting other people that people are empowered to speak out against that right? And start to dialogue about why we have commonalities, we should be emphasizing those. And I think there is lot of internet technologies that can be used for that to counter people who are using it to spread strife and division and so forth. So we’re actually spending fair amount of time on those kinds of issues. So hopefully that’s down the road of the very innovative app that you are suggesting.

And you’ll have the final question.
Unidentified Analyst
My name is Gene Boyden [ph] I am a stockholder, and I really liked Eric’s opening comment about asking hard questions, I have a granddaughter with autism; she is not quite five years old she does not speak now and probably never will. Although she probably will learn to write, most people communicate more verbally than in writing. My question is how can she talk to the world?
Dr. Eric Schmidt
A very profound question. We are doing a lot of thinking about how to approach these medical problems. The autism one is then the subject to the great deal of scientific work because it has a genetic basis in some situations. So, there is a whole bunch of programs that are very advanced and a number of them are using Google genetics platforms to do this kind of research. Any other comments?

No mention. Thank you everyone for coming.

I would just one, as a father of a 14 year old non-verbal autistic son. I can tell you that we’ve been trying to spend a fair amount of time on this. One of the -- and google.org which is our philanthropic arm, we -- our theme for this year is disabilities and cognitive disabilities is one of the things that we’re spending time on. So, we want to invest in organizations that are building new technologies to help people with cognitive disabilities including autism to learn better. It turns out there is a lot of ways we can figure out new interfaces for people to communicate. I know firsthand that people with autism and other such disabilities do communicate; they want to communicate and it’s up to us to figure out some great technologies to help them doing.

Thank you all for coming. We look forward to seeing you next year.
Dr. Eric Schmidt
Thank you all.
