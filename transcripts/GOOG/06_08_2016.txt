Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Executive Chairman of Alphabet, Dr. Eric Schmidt.
Eric Schmidt
Well, good morning. We were wondering about the music, as a sort of wake-up music. Thanks everybody for coming, it’s a delight to be here and welcome to our 2016 Shareholder Meeting. My name as you know is Eric Schmidt, I’m the Executive Chairman of Alphabet and I’m presiding over the meeting. Everybody here should have registered, if you have not registered, please register before you leave just so we know that you were able to attend. Everybody here has an agenda, on the reverse side we have a set of rules and procedures and so forth and please abide by those of course.
So we’re going to call this meeting to order. It is my distinct pleasure to introduce a number of people that I have worked with for a very long time and who are close friends and extraordinary leaders. John Doerr, is over here on the corner. My friend for at least 35 years and one of our key Directors of course, David Drummond will be with the shortly, Sundar Pichai is here and Ruth Porat is here and you’ll be hearing more from them later. Also with us is Mora Stanley [ph], a representative of computer share or transfer agents and she’s also going to act as our inspector of elections and Barbara Marchini-Ellis and Matthew Taggart represented E&Y are independent accounts, where are they. Can use stay a bit right here and over here. Okay, good hiding in the corner. 
And as it’s been our policy for those of you who’ve been here in the past, we’re going to have our former part of the meeting and what I’ll do is, I’ll come in and talk for a bit and then we’ll have a hopefully very interesting and impactful Q&A as we go. So what I want to do is introduce David, it’s hard to describe the contributions that David has made to this company to the industry. David [indiscernible] the incorporation documents of the original company, he also signed the incorporation documents of the new company, right David? So here and take us through all the formal things that we have to do, important activity.
So David Drummond, our Chief Legal Officer, Corporate Development and Secretary. Thank you, David.
David Drummond
Well, thanks very much Eric and welcome everybody to another annual shareholders meeting for Alphabet and we really appreciate you’re being here. So we’ll get started with the business of the meeting. And just a quick note before we begin, in terms of procedure stockholders should not address the meeting until we actually get chance to recognize you, we’ll provide a Q&A period at the end. So you can come up and ask questions to management. And that will be after the formal business of the meeting.
So when we get to the Q&A period, if you want ask a question, please move to one of the mics, we’ll have those setups and then when you sort of stand up, ask your question, identify yourself first, so we know who you are, state whether you’re a stockholder or you’re a stockholder representative and then ask your question. So thank you very much for adhering to these rules. Now I receive the affidavits of mailing from Computershare and Broadridge, which states that the notice for this meeting was dually given.
All stockholders of Class A and/or Class B common stock as of the close of business on April 11, 2016 are entitled to vote at the meeting. In addition, I’ve been advised by the inspector of elections that holders of our outstanding Class A and Class B common stock representing at least the majority of the voting power of that Class A and Class B common stock outstanding and that which are entitled to vote is represented today in person or by proxy. So therefore a quorum is present and the meeting is dually constituted and we can proceed with the business.

So first item of business is the election of directors, we have 11 directors, who will be elected at today’s meeting. Those directors will serve until 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The nominees are Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Eric Schmidt, John Doerr, Diane Greene, John Hennessy, Ann Mather, Alan Mulally, Paul Otellini, Ram Shriram, and Shirley Tilghman.
Now our byelaws require that stockholders provide advanced notice of their intent to nominate persons as directors. We didn't receive any such notice, so therefore I declare nominations of directors closed.
Now, the next matter being submitted is the ratification of our independent accountants, this is the appointment by the Board of Ernst and Young our registered public accounting firm. Our Board has recommended that our stockholders ratify this appointment of Ernst and Young for the 2016 fiscal year.
The next matter being submitted is the approval of an amendment to Alphabet's 2012 stock plan to increase the maximum number of shares of our Class C capital stock that may be issued under the plan by 11,500,000 shares of Class C capital stock and secondly to cap the aggregate amounts of stock based and cash based awards which can be granted under that plan to any non-employee member of the Board of Directors in any calendar year, with respect to the service on the Board to cap that amount at $1.5 million. Now our Board of Directors has recommended that our stockholders approve these amendments to the stock plan and those are described more fully in our proxy statement.
The next matter being submitted to our stockholder is approval of an amendment to the fourth amendment amended and restated Certificate of Incorporation of Google Inc., which is Alphabet’s wholly owned subsidiary, to remove a provision that requires the vote of the stockholders of Alphabet, in addition to the vote of Alphabet itself which is the sole stockholder of Google in order for Google to take certain actions. Our Board of Directors has also recommended that our stockholders approve this amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation and again that's described more fully in our proxy statement.
Now the next six items being submitted are all stockholder proposals. Our Board of Directors has reviewed all these proposals and recommends unanimously that our stockholders vote against these proposals that will be presented today. Now the first stockholder proposal is being brought by Mr. John Chevedden, Mr. James McRitchie, Ms. Myra Young and the NorthStar Asset Management Funded Pension Plan, as co-lead filers, and I believe we have Ms. Abigail Shaw, here she is of NorthStar Asset Management who is going to present the proposal.
Ms. Shaw you have three minutes, floor is yours.
Abigail Shaw
Good morning. My name is Abigail Shaw from NorthStar Asset Management in Boston, the beneficial owner of over $3.8 million of Alphabet common stock. As Alphabet shareholders know, our company has three classes of stock, Class A with one vote per share, Class C with zero votes per share and Class B with an overwhelming 10 votes per share which is closely held by management insiders. This discrepancy hands over a super majority of control of the firm to insiders, essentially making it impossible for stockholders to weigh in. Yet the concern we raise here is not just about fairness, we are also concerned that insiders and management seeks to insulate the governance of the firm from shareholder oversight.
Studies have shown that excessive voting control given to insiders leads to poor performance over the long term. In fact a study has reported that the more control that the insiders have, the more they can pursue strategies that are at the expense of outside shareholders. Studies have also shown that on average and over time, companies with multiclass capital structures underperform those with a one share, one vote standard in which owner’s economic risk is commensurate with voting power.

In a world where our company’s primary purpose is to expand access to information and knowledge in an open and democratic way, limiting substantial shareholder input is wildly counterintuitive. We feel that shareholder value is best derived when insider voting control of the firm is separated from insider economic ownership. Economic ownership provides enough of a reward for management when stock prices rise. The current tri-class structure eliminates shareholder checks and balances over management decisions. Without a tally of one vote per share claiming that stockholders accepted or rejected a proposal means little more than that Mr. Page, Mr. Brin and Mr. Schmidt voted for or against it.
We are very concerned that the use of insider control at Alphabet will inhibit shareholders from weighing in on company’s governance and policy issues with detrimental effect on shareholder value over the long-term. We urge you to vote for proxy item number five.
David Drummond
Thank you very much, Ms. Shaw. So we move to the next stockholder proposal which is being brought by Walden Asset Management as the lead filer, joined by a number of other organizations as co-filers and we have Ms. Danielle Ginach of Sonen Capital, who will be presenting the proposal.
Mr. Ginach, you have three minutes.
Danielle Ginach
Thank you very much and congratulations on pronouncing my name correctly. Good morning to Chairman and fellow shareholders. I am Danielle Ginach of Sonen Capital, an Impact Investment Firm based in San Francisco. I am representing Walden Asset Management, the primary sponsor of this proposal which earns 44,500 shares of Alphabet. On behalf of Sonen Capital, Walden and approximately 25 co-filers I am pleased to move resolution number six, which has been voted on Alphabet stockholders for the last several years.
As you can see this resolution seeks information on how Alphabet directly and indirectly works to affect legislation and public policy. This request for transparency has been made to hundreds of companies over the last five years having been acknowledged as best practice by the investment community. Lobbying is big business for Alphabet and in the last five years Alphabet spend over 79 million in Federal Lobbying and has been one of the top five companies Lobbying in the last few years. While Alphabet discloses a summary of their direct federal Lobbying on its Web site with links to reports they provide to the Senate, these Senate quarterly reports are very difficult to navigate and would be very easy to summarize these dollar spend quarterly and highlight the major issues Alphabet lobbied on along with the links adopting a best practice in disclosure and transparency.
Alphabet also does not disclose meaningful details on dues and grants provided to over 100 trade groups and advocacy organizations that it’s part of, nor how it evaluates whether the Lobbying positions of these organizations is consistent with Alphabet’s priorities and values as well as the Company Mantra to do no evil. In order to better understand Alphabet’s role in trying to affect legislation and regulation additional disclosure is needed. Once again we’d like to congratulate Alphabet for the company’s public decision to withdraw from Alec, a known climate denying group actively working to combat renewable energy standards at the state level. Alphabet acted on its stated values when it withdrew from Alec, an action we enthusiastically commend. Now over 100 companies have followed suit.
However there are other trade organizations whose actions conflict with Alphabet’s values for example Alphabet is an active member in the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a group which has spent over $1 billion on lobbying since 1998 and has currently sue the EPA to botch the EPAs clean power plan to address climate change. Clearly this creates an outright conflicts with our company’s stated environmental position to address, limit and mitigate the effects of climate change. Apple for example was so offended by the Chamber of Commerce’s policies and actions that they publicly withdrew membership.

As a logical expression of Alphabet’s stated policies we ask that the Company also speak out to proactively distance itself from the Chamber’s actions which impede climate policies at a national and global level, at a critical time following the Paris climate conference. We are pleased to see Alphabet joined with other companies in endorsing necessary forward-looking legislations and regulations on climate change otherwise. Our company remains a national leader in articulating and working to live by positive social and environmental values. Alphabet’s vision and environment -- echo the environmental ethics of many of its employees and deserves to be reflected on how lobbying dollars are spent.
Our final point, for several years investors have written to top management and filed resolutions on this topic simply seeking an opportunity to meet and talk with management and hear Google’s perspective. But our letters and calls have gone unanswered. We are perplexed that Alphabet has a strong investor relations record in general, so why wouldn’t the company simply agreed to meet or talk on its longest investors, who simply want to hear and better understand Alphabet’s policies to find a middle ground and make shareholder resolution such as this one unnecessary. Thank you very much.
David Drummond
Thanks very much Ms. Ginach. So the third stockholder proposal is being brought by Clean Yield Asset Management on behalf of John Fedor-Cunningham. I believe we have Mr. Michael Passoff of Proxy Impact to present this proposal.
Mr. Passoff, you have three minutes. Thanks.
Michael Passoff
Thank you. Good morning everybody. My name is Michael Passoff and I’ve been asked to read the following statements on behalf of the filers of the proposal Clean Yield Asset Management. Our proposal number seven on the proxy ballot calls on Alphabet to fully disclose the extent of its political spending. Specifically, Alphabet has refused calls to disclose what it contributes to the so called dark money non-profits, such as trade associations on 501(c) (4s). These are entities that can receive payments from corporations but do not have to disclose the source of the contributions. In 2012 and 2014 election cycle dark money groups spent more than $474 million to influence the electoral outcomes.
Two years ago in this venue a shareholder made the same point to Mr. Schmidt and he responded and I quote, “let me summarize the request. We need to be more transparent, is that right. We get it. We’ve heard that from a number of other shareholders, so let us come back to some ideas, we get a very good clear set of messages from a number of shareholders about this transparency issue already”, end quote. But there have been no ideas to-date, so we’d like to know why it's okay for Alphabet to contribute the company’s money secretly to groups that can spend it however they wish, even in ways that conflicted the company’s values.
Alphabet showed real spine when it quit Alec, but it still has an expanse political footprint, supporting about 140 trade associations and other non-profits across the political spectrum. The reputation risks are not hypothetical and Alphabet has come under heavy criticism in the media for its aggressively lobbying of the European Commission. These activities contribute to the public’s worst suspicion that the U.S. political system is rigged in favor of the large donors which is the key factor in the political instability we have experienced in the U.S.
Please vote and favor proposal number seven. Thank you.
David Drummond
Thank you, Mr. Passoff. The fourth stockholder proposal is being brought by the Firefighters' Pension System of the City of Kansas City Missouri, the Trust. Mr. Glen Johnson of Marco Consulting Group will be presenting his proposal.

Mr. Johnson please proceed.
Glen Johnson
Thank you, morning. The Firefighters Pension System of the city of Kansas City, Missouri requests the Board of Directors to amend the company's governance documents, provide that director nominees be elected by the affirmative vote of the majority of votes cast at an annual meeting of shareholders. A polarity [ph] vote standard would be retained for a contestant director elections. Under the company's current vote standard, a nominee for the board can be elected with as little as a single affirmative vote, even if a substantial majority of the votes cast withheld from the nominee. The firefighters believe a majority of vote standard in board elections would establish a challenging vote standard for board nominees and improve the performance of individual directors and entire boards. With a majority of votes standard in place the board can then consider an action on developing post-election procedures to address a status of directors that failed to win election. 
A majority of vote standard combined with the post-election director resignation policy would establish a meaningful right for shareholders to elect directors and reserve for the board an important post-election role in determining the continued status of an unelected director. We urge shareholders to vote for this proposal.
David Drummond
Thanks very much Mr. Johnson. I believe for the fifth stockholder proposal you have an encore performance, so this is brought actually by the Marco Consulting Group as the lead filer, please proceed.
Glen Johnson
Marco Consulting Group Trust asks the Board of Directors to adopt a policy that the Board's Chairman should be a director who has not previously served as an executive officer of the company and who is independent of management. The Chairman is responsible for protecting shareholders' long term interests by providing independent oversight of the Chief Executive Officer and management in directing the corporations affairs, Chairman of the Boards of publically held companies enhance oversight and accountability of management and ensure the objective functioning of an effective board be setting agendas, priorities and procedures for the board. The Marco Consulting Group views the alternative of a lead outside director, even one with a robust set of duties as adequate only in exceptional circumstances fully disclosed by the board.
If you agree with the proponent of this proposal that oversight of company management can be diminished when the Chairman is not independent, please support this proposal, thank you.
David Drummond
Thanks very much Mr. Johnson. So our final stockholder proposal is being brought by Arjuna Capital as the lead filer on behalf of clients, Alexander, Michael Baldwin, and Margarita Baldwin as well as the sustainability group on behalf of the William B. Perkins trust and proxy impact on behalf of CB Wealth Generation LLC, all its co-filers and I believe we have Mr. Passoff to come back for another three minutes.
Michael Passoff
Yes, thank you, thanks. So I'm here to move proposal number 10, the resolution asks Alphabet for reporting the company's policies and goals to reduce the gender paygap. This is a particularly important issue to the tech industry which struggles to attract and retain women workers and where male IT professionals reportedly earn nearly 10,000 more than female IT professionals on average.
The last store's 2014 tech company comparison by gender reports senior software engineers at Google earn $25,000 less than their male counterparts. Intel set the bar for what criteria should be included in a gender paygap report as they provided information on base salary, bonuses and stock awards. Using this formula they found a paygap and publically stated how they would address it.

Other companies including Apple, Amazon and Microsoft have been less forthcoming than Intel. Apple for instance says it has no gender paygap, but they only reported on base salaries which makes the conclusion questionable. When we spoke with Alphabet a few months ago, the company said it would only report on base salary the same as Apple. We told Alphabet that reporting on base salary is a good first step, but they need to account for a potential gender paygap must include base salary, bonuses and stocks and if Alphabet were willing to publicly commit to doing that by a specific date then we would withdraw the resolution. Alphabet came back and said it was not willing to commit to a report or timeline.
So my question to you is, do you want to be an industry leader or laggard. Will Alphabet follow industry leader Intel and provide a full financial accounts and identify steps it will take to address any problem or you'll copy Apple in eventually doing the minimum amount to try for a big headline that we have no paygap which no one will believe, since we haven't disclosed or the pay elements.
I assess the nation's largest proxy advisory services has already made up its mind as their vote recommendations states, a vote for this resolution is warranted as Alphabet lags its peers in addressing gender pay disparity, by not addressing this issue at the same level as peers Alphabet is put at a competitive disadvantage in recruitment of candidates and retention of employees. Alphabet can do better than this. So I'd like to ask you now in front of everyone to commit to a gender pay report that includes base salary, bonuses and stocks and to commit to a timeframe of when it'll be completed. Thanks very much.
David Drummond
Are you finished, you have 30 seconds.
Michael Passoff
Can we get a commit?
David Drummond
If you'd like to discuss this in the Q&A we can discuss it, so thanks very much Mr. Passoff. So before no further -- because no further business is scheduled to come before the stockholders, we're going to open the polls for those of you who haven't had a chance to vote yet. Obviously if you've previously voted by proxy, you don’t need to vote today, unless you wish to change your vote and I should advice you that we receive sufficient proxies before the meeting to know that the proposals we've discussed today will pass or fail in accordance with the recommendation from our Board of Directors that's in the proxy statement. We want to make sure everybody gets a chance to vote. So if you would like to vote and you have a ballet and you requested one or if you need one please raise your hand, we have some folks who can get one to you.
Okay looks like everyone who has requested a ballet has had a chance to receive one. You can go ahead and when you’ve completed, you can go ahead and pass it down to the aisle [ph] of folks collecting those. But at this point I can declare that the polls for each matter. They are voted upon at the meeting, are now closed and I'd like to direct the inspector of elections to collect all the ballets and it looks like we've got all of them, yes.
So results of voting, the inspector of elections is advising me to that the nominees for election to the board have been duly elected. I've also been advised that the majority of shares of our Class A and Class B common stock that are entitled to vote and are present today at the meeting or here by proxy have voted in favor of the ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young, as our independent registered public accounting firm for the 2016 fiscal year and second the approval of the amendments to our 2012 stock plan.
I've also been advice by the inspector of elections that at least two-thirds of the voting power of the issued and outstanding shares of our Class A and Class B common stock entitled to vote have also voted in favor of the amendment to Google’s fourth amended in re-stated certificate of incorporation. So therefore each of these proposals has been approved by our stock holders. 

In terms of stockholder proposals, I've been advice that the majority of the shares of Class A and Class B common stock entitled to vote and present at the meeting in person or by proxy have voted against, One, the shareholder proposal regarding equal shareholder voting. The stockholders proposal regarding a lobbying report, stockholder proposal regarding political contributions report, the stockholder proposal regarding the adoption of a majority vote standard for the election of directors and the stockholder proposal regarding an independent Chairman of the Board Policy and finally the stockholder proposal regarding a report on gender pay.
So therefore each of these stockholder proposals has not been approved by our shareholders. Now as soon as possible after the meeting we’ll have a final vote tabulation and we can -- we will provide those vote results on our Investor Relations Web site also in a filing with the SEC.
So that ends the official business of the meeting and I declare the formal portion of our meeting adjourned. Eric is going to come back and make a few remarks and you’ll have an opportunity to ask any questions that you might have. 
At this point I need to make the fund disclaimer that our remarks and presentations and answers to questions that you might ask may contain forward-looking statements about our business outlook and other matters. The actual results and outcomes for these things may of course differ from the forward-looking statements that we might make because of risks, uncertainty, the way of the world and these risks and uncertainties, we’ve spelled out in quite a bit of detail in our public filings with the SEC.
So with that I'll turn it over to Eric.
Eric Schmidt
[Audio/Video Presentation]
Thank you very much David for all of that, and we had a lot of fun with our videos, and so forth. You could see from our video, how important Voice has become. I wanted to spend a couple of minutes talking about where sort of the world is a little bit and the state of our industry. And I want to start by saying that I am a fan of the quote from Alan Kay that the best way to predict the future is to invent it, and I think we start from that premise here at Alphabet and Google and all of the others.
And it starts fundamentally with entrepreneurs. And I've become convinced that we need to produce more entrepreneurs everywhere, right, in every industry, all around the world, and all that kind of stuff. And we should take a minute and thank all the entrepreneurs that have created the great companies all around us; Starbucks, SAP, Microsoft, Tesla, Apple, Facebook, Google, you name it, and earlier generation of these companies as well. Because to these are people who somehow believe that they can make the world different and better, and they are willing to take their own lives, their own time, and so forth, and their own risk capital and put it together to create literally millions of jobs and ultimately trillions of dollars of wealth for all of us as shareholders and all of the people that we know.
The reason I want to emphasize entrepreneurs is that entrepreneurs are how we get out of the lot of problems in the world. Because entrepreneurs, as a general group, are the people who are going to invent the next solutions in chemistry, in medicine, in transportation, in information, and I want to talk a little bit about that. But we have a role too. Those of us who are not entrepreneurs, and I am not an entrepreneur, but I have great respect for them. We need to set more ambitious goals as a society. Somehow in the last decade, we have lost something that we used to do. We used to say here is a grand challenge, here is something which will change the world in an amazing way. People here who are old enough will remember the development of the interstate highway system, which was originally justified for moving military missiles around.

Now imagine if we hadn’t done that, what would have happened to the GDP and the growth of the states of our country. So there is example after example of the sort of great challenges, whether it's man on the moon, literally a true moon shot. But many of others, the human genome project, the race.
How did these things happen? Well, what’s interesting was that the technology for these things was developing and there was a point at which there was a consensus to develop among a number of people, it wasn’t just one person. We also like to celebrate the one entrepreneur, but in fact these are ecosystems of people who ultimately came together to build all of the piece parts. In our industry, this is the PC revolution, the Internet revolution, there is no single founder of all of this. It’s a set of people who knew each other, who figured out a way to grow this and make it happen.
The U.S. government can help here, for example, Obama has announced brain initiatives, Vice President Biden has announced a cancer initiative, Sean Parker just donated $250 million because there was a new breakthrough in immunotherapy -- excuse me, involving boosting white blood cells at the cost of red blood cells that works. There was a consensus that somehow we could make substantive forward progress right then and there. So there are these moments in time, and I want to highlight some of those and explain how that ties to what we are doing here.
But it seems to me that the core issue is the lack of imagination and a lack of asking what can we all do? If you go back to the John F. Kennedy quotes, what can you do for your country? What can we do, as citizens, as political players, as donors, as shareholders, and leaders to try to address this? I am personally tired of the zero-sum gain, that everybody says well nothing can change. I think we’ve got evidence that an awful lot is going to change and get much, much better.
Now before I talk about some of the general things, let me highlight some of the things that I just literally made a list of things that had happened recently at Alphabet, and we can talk about this in the questions. We have a project in a company called DeepMind that is in an attempt, we started off trying to play the game of Go, you what Go is, it’s a very, very hard game, is thought to be incomputable. And the underlying algorithm, which mimics human intuition, was used to call the choices and ultimately win against the best human in the world listed all in Korea in March for one [ph]. But an enormous accomplishment, both for the game of Go, because everyone now playing is playing much better, but more importantly the development of those algorithms.
This happened because of curiosity, it happened because people cared about it. Google Fiber is now in five cities and once you are on it you would never leave, that power, the strength of that platform. By the way the cities are, Kansas City, Provo, Atlanta, Nashville and Austin. I wished I lived in one of those, that’s how important that is for us. Self-driving cars, I'll talk about this some more. But we are now testing in Kirkland, Phoenix, Austin and Mountain View and we have done a deal with Fiat Chrysler to do a 100 modified mini-vans to begin developing this into a real products.
Verily, our life sciences group, Verb Surgical, is a joint venture, it would change a medical [indiscernible] to joint ventures, is developing surgical solutions that incorporate a leading edge robotic capabilities using machine learning. In short, think about what that will do for reproducibility of these results. There is a promising collaboration with Biogen that we’ve just announced and bringing [ph] in women’s hospital to study multiple sclerosisand and there is an idea that these entrepreneurs have that we can take the digital world that I am more familiar with and apply it to areas where people have been doing bespoke work and then we consist in ties for example the diagnosis and treatment of multiple sclerosisand. There is a feeling that this can be done for other dieses for example certain mental dieses and so forth.

And as on the side, with respect to Verily, I want to say that we have put in place a very, very strong oversight group. There has been always stuff in the news about other companies in our case it was very, very confident, not only their approaches but also the controls, reviews and processes that will ultimately produce in amazing medical breakthroughs. Nest right we have, millions of people using Nest thermostats in more than 200 countries, we have a whole product line now at 12,000 retail stores during and it’s growing at 50% year-over-year, faster than the overall company.
We have these balloons right? And balloons are floating around in the southern atmosphere providing test singles for LTE, singles for people in incredibly rural area and when you study the globe, the hardest area to get a cell signal in and in the most improvised areas, over the southern hemisphere in place like remote Brazil and in Africa, in the ways everybody here knows, that that stuff actually works.
We have group under Alphabet called Sidewalk Labs and they’ve decided to re-think the way cities work. Now most people live in cities, cities are the engines of growth, there is more productivity in cities, there is lots of crowd, and lots of issues. We think we can apply new technologies of one kind or another in conjunction with and in this case a group called transportation of America, but to do this and in fact there are now best cities initiatives, which we’re competing in.
We’re sort of educating people on what is possible using the merger of digital technology and the problems that have in those cities for a very long time. This is a platform, that’s again innovative and revolutionary. And off course, I have to talk about Google, I tried to make a list of Google accomplishments and it’s so long it’s sort of takes too long right? So you can talk about it, in the Q&A. We have seven products, right? It’s extraordinary, with more than 1 billion monthly active users, right? Search, Maps, Gmail, Chrome, Android, Google Play and YouTube and I probably missed one or two smaller ones.
In my career I never thought, we would get to 1 billion in one and certainly when we started here and when I started here it was inconceivable you would get to that. Due to a sense of the impact that Google has had overall, I think, given the example in the 1 billion club, there are now more than 1 billion users of Chrome on mobile right? So if you’re not even in Chrome, you’re missing the party, also you’re more vulnerable to security attacks, it’s faster, it’s also free, the ideal price.
I’m a huge user of Google photos. Now Google photos and all you know Google photos no big deal, it’s a huge deal. Because you upload your photos, you do this exactly once in your life time and then the algorithms that we use, organize them and its completely private to you and they will do face recognition and even organize by all your friends and family, it will do various event recognition and so forth, all again incredibly private and incredibly under your control.
This is just the beginning of machine learning applied to our life right? In the sense that, I love this, I have my entire life literally from pictures of my parents when I was born and I can sit there and look of the evolution of me right? The good and by the way the bad, which I will not discuss, because the pictures are pretty horrific, like when I was a teenager. In the enterprise space we have more than 2 million paid businesses using Google Apps for work, right? So again the scale of this is amazing.
Now why do we do this, right? Well if I go back to this moon shot idea of a sort of notion, that I said that we’re not dreaming big enough, since a year ago this Company has said, we’re going to do our part to set a broader agenda, that we’re literally going to say, these are solvable problems and we created this other initiatives, some will do great, some will do poorly, they are led by very strong CEOs, it’s a dynamic environment right? We’ll change them, we’ll address them, but we’re very serious about it and we spend a great of a time trying to manage these as independent business to build real businesses that scale. And over the next few years you’ll see the once that will grow very quickly and the one which will add and the ones which will sort of go and try to resuscitate because the product didn’t work as wells as we wanted and that’s how innovation really works.

So to give you some examples and I’ll do this relatively quickly, of what the future could hold and these are not necessary things we’re currently working on, I was trying to make a list of sort of the five or six most interesting things that are going to happen in the next five or ten years and I was thinking first about what I called, nerds [ph] over cattle.
Now I like cattle as much as anybody else does, but the fact of the matters is 10% of global warming comes from beef and beef byproducts and the fact that cattle exists. And if you could figure out a way to do think like meat from plants and from growing, from cellular organisms and so for and there is now a huge industry right? Google is not a direct player in this, but it’s an example of what is possible.
Can you imagine in fact, you could build, you could grow and they are starting to doing this now, perfectly great stake, that’s grown organically in such a way that it isn’t full of pesticides and those kind of things, [indiscernible] and particular with antibiotics. Very interesting, again even if you don’t like the idea, imagine if it tastes really good, we’ll see.
3D printing of building right? We hear about 3D printing all the time, there are people now building 3D printing of building where they say, we thing we can build buildings much, much more quickly. We’re painting the dynamic nature and differentiator and all [indiscernible] looks like white boxes and so forth. But imagine if we can get the cost of those buildings down by a factor of 3 or 4 or 5 using new materials and allow you to remodel them very quickly and things like that. There are people working on this, Google in fact has a large in Virtual Reality and the idea here is that many people are working high-end aspects of the virtual reality but they are too expensive, we want to do things, we have this product called cardboard which I am sure you’ve seen, and there is a whole suite of products to offer video and entertainment and we think that this is going to be a very large future revenue stream for example, in the entertainment industry, sports, games, that kind of stuff.
We’re also working on augmenting reality, augmenting reality is when you look through your normal eye, the two that you have, but we give you additional information around you rather than giving you a completely different world and there is evidence that we can now do that in ways that really improves your productivity and make you work better and so forth. Google glass was a first attempt at that, with much more comment.
I’ll give you another example having to do with medicine. It’s pretty clear that the mobile phone is going to be something that will be a life saver for you in a sense that it will be your primary health monitoring device. Now it will have things attached to it, right -- devices of one kind of other, for example the equivalent of a wrist band, we’ll be able to monitor your health and transdermal monitoring is now possible.
Again our Verily group has projects of this category that they’ve talk about, with respect to diabetes monitoring, where they literally there is a contact lens which has the world’s smallest battery which then essentially WiFi out the status of your glucose level. Now if you’re one of the very many people who have diabetes in America and by the way it’s worse in many other countries, this is going to be a life saver, in terms of keeping you alive especially as the disease progresses.
Does this matter? Absolutely. It’s pretty clear for example that imaging in radiology is now a solved problem by computers and that if I have a scan or a dermatological scan or whatever, I really want the computer to read it and then I want the human to sort of see if they agree. Now you’ll say, why would you want to do it that way? I’ll give you an example, we have our project and there is a disease called diabetic retinopathy, where the diabetes gets bad enough that the back part of your retina gets screwed up and you go blind.

It’s a horrific disease especially in the open world. We can detect it 99% of the time, the average -- sorry, the best ophthalmologist gets it right about 90% of the time. And how is that possible, right, I mean I’m not an ophthalmologist, our engineers are not ophthalmologist, how do they do it. The answer is really simple. They see more eyes, they saw a million eyes, whereas the average ophthalmologist sees 10,000 to 20,000. So you sit there any you go, what a key insight, so that we can now do, right. And these are projects in various states in our research labs for things that we care about.
There is a revolution in genetics, there is a technology called CRISPR-Cas9 which allows you to sort of add and delete genes, right and you could do it in a particular way. There are projects now to start beginning new genetic sequences with an eventual goal for example of the ability to construct a chromosome. Because of the merger of machine learning, data bases and then the science work which is noble price winning from a number of players, its possible now to really unlock the keys of life, do you care about this? It’s the reason that you’re going to ultimately get a drug that will cure cancer, right the cancer that you have or the other genetics related that are possible. And if you spend anytime recently with somebody suffering through this you’ll understand how important it is.
Now what’s Google’s role here? It turns out that we have platforms that due to manipulation of this data, now we’re not scientists in this area, with the exception of Google Lifesciences, but we have an initiative called the Google Brain initiative where we try to sort of take this kind of data and Google Brain does this for many things including the examples that I am using. You put it in the database and you manipulate it for a while and you get insights that humans can’t get because of scale and that’s where the real sort of amazing things are.
When we look at what could we do, DeepMind for example just announced a partnership with the National Health Service. There is a disease in Britain called Acute Kidney Injury which is more of a highest rates of deaths in hospitals and its where your kidney stops working and I don’t understand the medical part of it, but as I’ve been told that that it can proceed very quickly, very badly or not, and the outcome matters a great deal to you, as a patient and obviously for the hospital. We have early evidence that we can predict quite accurately based on blood test and your history the rate of decline. Does that matter, you bet and especially in a tough triage kind of situation where they are trying to figure out how to apply limited resources to save the most lives, it really saves lives. Again the application of these technologies to problems that have bedeviled us for a very, very long time.
I mentioned the self-driving cars, I don’t want to be cruel in the first part of the morning, but I’ll say it as bluntly as I can, there are 32,800 people who are scheduled to die this year on America highways, we just don’t know who. That is a horrific number, it’s not -- and by the way that’s considered the best number ever on a miles driven basis. How could you expect that, why is this not a national crisis? We’re half way through our quota, I mean it’s just horrible and these are often young people, in the prime of their lives, everyone end up in a funeral and so forth.
I'm frankly beside myself over the lack of consensus on how important this problem is. We have activities here I highlighted the testing that we're doing and we have a number of other companies that are working on this as well. This should be a national priority, to basically figure out a way to get this technology to save lives, right. I mean I can joke about how the computer will drive much better than you are, especially if you're drunk. But the serious point is, that we're talking about 30,000 people in America plus or minus and 1.3 million or more million worldwide this year who are going to die, in my view unnecessarily.

Let's say we could cut that by half, right. Imagine the impact of that compared to the other things that we fund. Where is the national priority? Where is the goal? Where is the funding, right? These are ideas that are ready, remember I said earlier, it's ready right, our technology is ready and it guides [ph] that the other folks are doing is ready. It's time for this to take off. We're doing it for that reason and not for any other.
There's an opportunity in education and again there are start-ups working on this, a couple that I know well, that what they're doing is they're basically saying, what we're going to do is we're going to keep the teacher in the classroom, but we're going to use computer learning and machine learning to help the students get more individualized lesson plans. The teacher teaches differently, but the teacher is crucial. But the students learn much better and those were the early results. Does that matter, there are three million schools in America and we all understand how important it is to get a stronger education system for the many challenges that lie ahead in economic growth in our great country.
But perhaps that I think is the most profound is where we've spent most of our time and I'll finish up with this as an example. Larry, a few years ago said what he really wants to go, is from search to suggest. He wants to go from you typing a query and then getting an answer, to us really helping you on a day-to-day basis. And out of that came an issue there which is internally known as the Assistant. And we can talk about this with Sunder when we -- in just a sec.
And the idea is that we want to build systems that assist you in everything you're doing, stuff that you just saw in a little funny video, it's all based on that. We just introduced a product called Allo and people have said, well it's an instant messaging app, yes. But it's an instant messaging app that actually understands your EDM and learns your EDM well enough to help you reply and help you answer, right. It knows a lot and again completely under your control and completely under your own privacy and so forth. We just introduced, it’s not shipping yet, a home device, its voice actuated which is usually the standard technology.
Now, how does this apply, right, where we will use this? Well we’ll use this to do everything, right. Doesn't this also apply for search? Doesn't it apply also for YouTube? Doesn't it apply for -- so forth? So, the strategy is although you're seeing it in these particular snippets and the funny story was that six months ago, they tried this on email, right. So, they ran these things called, the term is Smart Reply on email and who would not want the computer to reply to all of your emails, so they don’t have to, right. All of us have this problem.
So, they ran it, they turned it on and it's most common reply was, I love you. Not the correct email response, especially in a corporation. So, let's just say that there were some bugs. But we've got that one fixed. But the important point is that imagining a situation where the computer is helping you not just to understand, but really get through the day and everybody has these problems. And imagine if it's a mom, right, overloaded mom, or overloaded college person, or an overloaded executive and an overloaded worker in a corporation.
Or imagine if it's a scientists who's about to make a major discovery and your system is so good at looking at the change of information that the Assistant can make a suggestion. And if that key suggestion is the basis for the intuition of a human, it's the first time a true partnership can really emerge between the kinds of things that computers are very good at and the kinds of things that we are very good at. I'm very much looking forward to that, I think it will be transformative for our company. I think you'll benefit as shareholders from this in innumerable ways.

So, with that I hope that, that was a short sense of what we were trying to get done at Alphabet and I think we'll bring up our panelists and I'm looking forward to your questions. David do you want to come up, Ruth do want to sort of come up? Is Sunder here is yet? Okay, Sunder come on up. David, I've already introduced. We need like two -- as usual we’re disorganized, let's get a couple of more chairs.
Ruth come on up, Ruth is an extraordinary leader in our industry, she had quite the career on, in the financial side, and I think you all know the impacts that she has had on our investor relations and our financials and upon arriving here she took on the challenge of rationalizing and building real businesses in Alphabet and she can speak for that.
To say that Sunder is the best CEO, speaking of the former CEO would be an understatement. And I’ve watched him, he's been here for a decade as an executive, but recently a CEO for about a year and to watch him navigate the challenges in this space, I go, Oh, my god. Right, we're so fortunate to have Sunder, literally as the CEO of our favorite part of Alphabet, Google which is why you're all here.
So, with that perhaps you have comments or questions. Can you folks line up at mics, any question is fine. Who would like to start first?
Question-and-Answer Session
A - David Drummond
Yes ma'am go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst
I am Linda from [indiscernible], first time coming to your meeting.
David Drummond
Welcome.
Unidentified Analyst
I noticed that a lot of other proposals dealt with your financial obligations. I thought we were going to get cute a little bag or cap or mug. I know to you it's not that big but to me it is can you bring it back?
David Drummond
Who is in-charge of this? David or Ruth, this is a retail failure on the part of you all.
Unidentified Analyst
I guess me.
David Drummond
Duly noted, we will reconsider that and maybe next year.
Unidentified Analyst
Thank you. It's a little thing, but…
David Drummond
No, no we get it.
Unidentified Analyst
It is a big thing to me.
David Drummond
Excellent suggestion.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay.
Eric Schmidt
Okay never again.
David Drummond
Never again, okay. Thank you very much. Yes, ma'am.
Unidentified Analyst
Thank you. I am Danielle Ganas of Sion Capital. So I wanted to bring up Google's work in renewable energy. Google has taken on and also that has taken on a remarkable leadership and adjusting the need towards moving to a clean energy future, especially in emerging markets and we do commend that commitment and the capital that’s been activated and the leadership surrounding that. So earning capital my sum is one of over 30 investors that wrote to Google last call asking for a better understanding of how the company assesses and responds to the impact large energy development, have on local human rights and getting it to people and communities, as you would imagine renewable energy installations and equipment being are active in emerging market have consequences that there are some times unintended. And so what we didn’t received with any response from the company that helps us understand your approach and so the remaining question is how you think about human [indiscernible] people rights as part of the clean energy program? Since we did receive point IFC guidelines which are just that a simple guideline and we would like to urge you and kind of reiterate in a question to ask, what is the knowledge that in partnerships and policies that you will be pursuing in regard to protecting these rights around renewable energy development?
Eric Schmidt
Ruth runs the investment side.
Ruth Porat
So on the investment side, we are very committed to sustainability, it's very core that the way we are running our businesses and the team that leads all that we are doing in data centers has a very strong lens on that in particular our products as the way we have looked at sustainability and our footprint. And to your point we have invested in a number of important initiatives around the globe, are proud of what we have done in a number of areas and sustainability overall is an area you have seen as I think be a real leader and something that is core to our founders and the senior leadership team and we remained very committed to. In terms of the other points that you raised I am not sure if you want to add something that is duly noted we will look into further.

David Drummond
Yes, we will look into that and let me give you some more feedback on how we look at the impact on local communities and so forth. But certainly it's something that’s important to us, we take -- we have worked with our partners on the ground. Because most of these projects are done with folks in those communities and so we do work with them locally, but we can find ways to give you more feedback on that.
Unidentified Analyst
All right, thank you.
Eric Schmidt
So I believe you have been at every shareholder meeting or as I told have been so you are especially welcome this morning.
Unidentified Analyst
Thank you. The first one I want to -- you and I, you sat down with us at lunch. Now we don’t have lunch anymore.
Eric Schmidt
Well, thank you for coming after breakfast.
Unidentified Analyst
My name is Shelton Ehrlich I have been a shareholder for quite a well. I wanted to defend our corporation against some of the criticism by the proposers, I bought my shares knowing that this company was going to run by an elite the people who founded it and built it. And it's an interest experiment, you have a public corporation can be managed on the win of three or four people with lots of input from others, but still whatever you guys want you do. And we knew it when we bought it and to criticize it now given its one of the largest corporations in the world and we have all made a lot of money is ridiculous. I wanted to make a comment on lobbying, lobbying is not just dollars it's face-to-face meetings. I believe that Google is the number one visitor -- corporate visitor to the White House, is that true?
Eric Schmidt
I think we have no way of knowing exactly what's true, I mean that’s been reported and we do defiantly have made visits to the White House.
Unidentified Analyst
You get there often people. Instead of telling us how many dollars you spend, how about writing down the notes, publishing the notes you have taken. So we know it's going on. And of course I have to always say this, environmentalism is a religion here. Germany, Denmark and England have decided to reduce their investments in windmills. We should be doing that here because they’re shopping birds of into little pieces. And I wish you agree, I think your policy is on climate.
David Drummond
Thank you very much for your comments and I think we’re very much looking for your participation next year, any comments on Shelton’s comments? No. Okay. Yes, sir.
Unidentified Analyst
Yes. My first question is for the lady CFO and based on your evaluation having experience working in the Los Vegas. Do you consider Alphabet stock as being undervalue or overvalue and what you basic on? And my second question is to Mr. Drummond, when you said reconsider does it mean no or yes?
David Drummond
Okay, agreed.
Unidentified Analyst
I know how lawyers are.
David Drummond
Our CFO Ruth, please answer.
Ruth Porat
The one thing I have always advised so as my clients and as CFO leaders is don’t focus on the stock price, focus on doing the right thing and the stock price will follow. And I’m very confident that we’re focused on the right thing. So what we’re focused on doing is continuing to invest in the great business that we have. And making sure that to quote Larry incremental leads to irrelevance, we’re not just doing the incremental we’re also doing the big idea. So that when we hear next year and in five years and in 10 years, so it’s going to be really proud of all the investments we’re making very much to Eric’s opening comments, so excited about the future.
Eric Schmidt
David?
David Drummond
I believe the question was about the, what we affectionately call swag for, and the answer is yes, we’ll bring it back.
Eric Schmidt
We got a clear answer. Okay. Yes, sir.
Unidentified Analyst

Roy Finklestein I am a stockholder. I’m also getting on in years and realize I’m not going to be driving forever. I’m very interested in what you think the timeline for self-drive cars will be in terms of, what would be available, when will it be available, how will it be implemented partially fully freeways local traffic plus at a country whatever?
Eric Schmidt
And maybe a number of us can talk about that. We have announced a collaboration with CF Chrysler to begin that and a lot of is depends on the regulations of the state and federal level, would you like to add?
Sundar Pichai
Eric the only thing I would add is kind of seen the tech industry for a long time. We view this as Eric framed the importance of addressing the start. So for me it’s much more than just us one company doing it. It’s very important, we have set in wheel instead of things and I think now there are many, many people and the echo system across the world is beginning to think about it, address it. And so I think it’s going to tremendously accelerate the change we see in a 10-year timeframe, I do think these things are going to look very-very different. And so we remain very optimistic.
Eric Schmidt
I might need to apologize for my sort of almost angry tone. When we talk about the depth, but let’s review the date. All right, the first projects for self-driving were funded in the darker world in 1996, 1997. The Stanford challenge, the original challenge that Stanford won was won in 2004 and 2005. And by the way that was 11 years ago. And you and I are still not driving in self driving cars today. So it’s time, right and it’s late in the sense that we’ve been developing these things as an industry for more than a decade right. And many of the people, who are working at a Google right and in the self-driving world have been working on this in your own carriers for 10 or 15 years, it works, it’s time to make it legal, to literally be testing it, find the miles at work and offer it, because of the many reasons that you cited.
Unidentified Analyst
Do you have any estimate of timeline in terms of best guess and really mean for guessing is a lot of things beyond your control. But I mean, do you see me in 10 years calling up [indiscernible] come over pick me up and drive me to where I tell it to go or is that in 20-year or 30-year?
Eric Schmidt
It’s very hard to know the consensus, I think within the company is it some years not decades that it is very much dependent on regulation and it also depends on where you are, it’s obviously a great deal easier to do this in areas that are similar that for example have ample parking things like that.
Unidentified Analyst
Thank you.
Eric Schmidt
Yes, sir.
Unidentified Analyst
All right Michael Paso from [Proxy Impact]. I just wanted to follow-up with the question I ask when discussing the proposal on gender equity pickup. This issue has got about a tonne of press to turn particularly about the tech industry, a lot of companies have started to move on and make commitments they’re doing it at different levels. As I said Intel is looking at more elements than others. So we have leaders and laggers and where is Alphabet, it’s just not even and so up to the laggers space?
Eric Schmidt
With respect I actually disagree with the framing of your question. We have our company meeting in this room and what we do is we call up unsuspecting executives and tell them to answer the question. That unsuspecting executive has been the leader in this area and is I think national leader in gender and equity pickups, his name is Wells [indiscernible] he is joining us on stage coming on up Wells as well.
Unidentified Company Representative
Thanks. And testament is being unexpected.
Eric Schmidt
And you’re exactly not dressed for [indiscernible] shareholder.

Unidentified Company Representative
I apologize for under-dressing.
Eric Schmidt
No, this is the normal outfit of Google.
Laszlo Bock
We actually in April, I authored an editorial in the Washington Post disclosing publicly that we had no pickup at Google among genders whether you look at salary or bonus or equity. We went to step further and actually posted it on our site that's called Rework talking about how any company can actually setup a structure that guarantees that there is no wage equity gap. What we see at Google is that absolutely in society there is a material gap and in fact when we hire women at Google on average they get a 30% greater salary increase than men do because out in the real world women are paid way less than men. So we address it and there is a number of steps you can take which we detail on the site which we can chat about afterwards. But the idea is we care deeply about this and it's not sufficient to actually solve the problems of inclusion and diversity if you still have structure differences in how your reward and compensate people. We don't have those differences at Google and we monitor every single pay cycle to make sure that they don't creep in and we monitor at the promotional cycle as well because we want to make sure that you're paid based on the impact of your work and not because of how you look or how you identify or where you come from.
Unidentified Analyst
I read that outfit I like that outfit, but I have the same question then as I do now, where is the data to back it up if you have all this information why not just put it out in the reports?
Eric Schmidt
I am going to turn that into Laszlo publish more I just told him privately. Since I disagree with the premise of your question, I think its fair challenge to us to try to prove to you that we're not lying to you since our job is management of the Company and our job is to make sure that we have the absolute best talent and they're fully and completely rewarded. We spend a lot of time on this and I am happy to work to convince you that this is true, but I actually know this is true, so same as I say prior let's publish more.
Unidentified Analyst
And we get a commitment give us a date we can expect this?
Eric Schmidt
Not to worry.
Unidentified Analyst
These things are the commitment that's the same problem.
Eric Schmidt
This is not a management meeting but I can assure you we take this incredibly seriously.
Unidentified Analyst
When we have a commitment I believe you.
Eric Schmidt
Since you're not an employee I will not make you that commitment but I can assure so we're very clear we make this commitment to our employees and we take it very seriously, yes sir.
Unidentified Analyst
My name is Brad Bates and I am a former mayor for Turlock, California. We're in the valley just to the East where we actually milk the global warming cows and grow things. I have been a shareholder since the IPO and so I would like to thank you first for breakfast and second for putting two of our daughters through undergrad at U2C, it turned out that Google was actually a slightly a better investment than your standard college plan. So my question…
Eric Schmidt
And can I say that we care a lot of her educations so that is a great story. That is a great story.
Unidentified Analyst
My question, your folks over Google Fiber have commented recently on getting closer to solving the very big last mile connection problem and I think they're talking about doing that with a wireless, fixed wireless solution well as an investor and hopefully as a future fiber customer, I think that's a pretty big deal and I am just wondering if you can share any more about how that project is coming?
Eric Schmidt
To give you an idea how serious this is, we have lengthy meeting Ruth and I and the usual suspects here and Larry and the leaders of that literally yesterday on this question, the simple answer is that there appears to be a wireless solutions that are point-to-point that are inexpensive now because of the improvements in semiconductors that these point-to-point solutions are cheaper than digging up your garden and so forth. And they can carry the gigabyte performance that was before that and the reason that is true is, miniaturization is well-being targeting and I think that's where the wins will be. We don't have anything to announce there. There is a lot of initiatives in the industry around that. Do you want to say anything more about that?

Ruth Porat
Just that we're pleased we've announced 22 cities at point and we're continuing to execute against it and every time we go into a city that we're working closely with cities and I think that partnership is another part of it. So we have the approach to the city and the business model in the one hand and the technology in the other and so look forward to you being a happy user there as well.
Unidentified Analyst
I am hoping I don't have to move to Portland.
Eric Schmidt
Good we have the same goal. Yes ma'am.
Unidentified Analyst
So I have a comment for my question I am sorry to put another shareholder on the spot, but Mr. Porat is the actually the CFO and not the lady CFO and I would like to take this opportunity to commend you all honest diversity and board and management it is certainly something we're very proud to see as shareholders and I personally am very happy to see and hope other companies will follow suit. And my question is on the chamber of commerce point that I raised when reading Walden's comment, I am just curious about what that conversations sounds like, it seems like there must be a debate about Google's membership and benefits of remaining a member of the chamber of commerce so just curious if you can give us some insight of the conversation?
Eric Schmidt
Sure I mean the membership of the chamber is something we've talked about and we've had actually has debated here. We, there are a number of positions that they've taken, we don't agree with them on for instance they're sort of lined up behind Hollywood and sort of their Copyright maximalism as we call it that we think cycles innovation and we've made our views known about that, we've made our views known about in some of these climate issues, the climate issues as well. We've decided on balance that there are a lot of things that they being a member does help Google a lot right in terms of lot of things that are pro-innovation at the chamber that pushes for, but it's not like a slam dunk obvious cost so it's something that we do evaluate from time to time. So we value the input from shareholders on this point and this is something we’ll continue to sort of evaluate whether on balance it make sense.
David Drummond
And on your diversity comments we spend a fair amount of time convincing ourselves that we were always right on this question that a diverse workforce a one which is inclusive gender or sexual preference race [indiscernible] on actually producing better shareholder returns. So even if you don’t really care about that on a moral basis, which we do, it produces better results. So I can assure you we’re committed to the point you made. And speaking as your male executive chairman I celebrate the others who are male and female in our company. But it's funny that we don’t -- we work so closely together it doesn’t even occur to us and that’s the best kind of diversity, it's really a phenomenal way to run a company. And I feel very strongly about it and I know these guys do as well, yes sir.
Unidentified Analyst
Hi Eric, my name is Robert Clothier and I am sorry I didn’t have this question when we had lunch together 5 years ago but I am an active generian and I am really concerned about the next 10 years. What I’ve heard about Calico is so encouraging and I wonder if you could enlighten me a little more without violating the top secret.
Eric Schmidt
I actually asked Calico and they’re so concerned about staying focused, they’ve really not tried to do much press about what they’re doing. They did announce a partnership with Jackson Laboratory, a biomedical research firm to study the genetics of health and longevity but we don’t think Calico is their very much basic science they’re trying to look at how cells change as we age everybody is subject to that. They believe that there are ways in which they can affect that in various complicated ways I don’t fully understand. But they’re very much a research lab for aging of biology and cells. And so hopefully for you and I the results will come out pretty quickly.

Unidentified Analyst
It's thrilling.
Eric Schmidt
Yes, it's very exciting. And by the way the quality of the work is astounding is best I can tell, yes sir.
Unidentified Analyst
My name is Daniel and I haven’t been here for several years, one of the reasons that I decided to show up in person because the last time I was here along that wall there, there was several kiosks with employees showing products and answering questions and features. And I am really disappointed that’s not there because one of the things that I do is I help a lot of people with technology, especially who are retired and older. And there is a lot of people out there who could use your products or to use them more if they were easier to use if the features were well known, if actually errors and bugs could be reported easier. And there is an element of facelessness when everything is done through email, you send it somewhere you hope, someone replies, sometimes they do, sometimes they don’t. So I really missed the in-person interaction where I can learn and I can actually pass that on to other people and I would even be willing to help you do that to improve your products as an impartial outsider.
Eric Schmidt
I think that’s a great idea, to bring that back.
Sundar Pichai
I mean we do have forums like that for example just recently we had our developer conference in which we have dozen people and in settings like that we do a lot of it, but this is good feedback and I we will personally find a solution.
Unidentified Analyst
Right I mean like everything is moving to digital online, but there is a lot of things where reading the New York Times holding your hand is really different by one say it's going to go away, but it is different. And there’re a lot of people who have this, let’s a dual mindset analog-digital.
Eric Schmidt
We agree, and I would encourage you to use your Android phone to read your New York Times the app is excellent.
Unidentified Analyst
Good morning. I am Chino and I am teacher from Burlingame. And I just wanted to know how much do you guys prioritize education? And if you can say a little bit more about your efforts in education? I know you mentioned the teacher in the classroom. But do you have any other efforts to support them?
Sundar Pichai
I’ve always seen education as one of the closest things related to our core mission. Our mission is to bring knowledge to everyone in the world and obviously education is a foundational way to do it. All through the years we’ve always tried hard to see how we can -- we see us as building tools that enable educators, teachers, parents, children, and so we’ve always been pushing the boundary on what’s possible. Today if you go not just in the U.S. but schools all around the world Google apps, things like Gmail, Google Docs and other products are what a lot of students use and teachers use to drive it.
But a few years ago we launched Chromebooks as a way to really change how education can be done with technology in classrooms. And it's had greater option. We are now beginning to think about how do we use our platforms like Android and YouTube, how do we make it easy for educators to create content, digital content, which are available on these platforms that will help educators as well. So there is a journey we are organizing ourselves better internally and you will see us do a lot more. We even do education symposiums every year now with education ministers from around the world. So we are looking to work with governments and the communities to see how we can do all this better.
Eric Schmidt
There is actually an article this week about how Chromebooks are now the number PC category which I was just shocked and astounded by, it's a testament under, you drove that projects I think you undersold how incredibly impactful Chromebooks could be, partly because they're incredibly powerful and relatively inexpensive, right so they've sort of combined both. The other that you didn't remember is Google Classroom, right which in fact we have something like 60,000 schools are using this now, it's growing very-very quickly and that's a teacher tool and in your role I would take a look at Google Classroom. Yes sir, is there a gentleman in the back? Oh no. Let's go with -- I'm sorry have the mic the first and then go ahead.

Thank you.
Eric Schmidt
I am sorry.

I just wanted to complement you and thank you for continuing to hold an actual shareholders meeting. I am so upset with companies like Meg Whitman and Hewlett Packard that go to virtual reality baloney that they don't want to take the time to in fact meet face to face with the people that put their money into the company to have it succeed and I want to complement you and thank you for continuing to do that. Please do not change.
Eric Schmidt
Thank you very much. Let's see, yes sir.
Unidentified Analyst
Ah yes, my name is Dennis [indiscernible], and my questions are not well prepared.
Eric Schmidt
That's okay my answers are not well prepared either.

The first one is about the self-driving car, is about AI in general. The self-driving car I do remember that Carnegie Mellon already drove a car coast to coast 20 years ago, so as you said the problem seems not to be the technical problems it seems to be the regulations. Now if you're to get Airbnb and Uber what kind of push back in Europe about getting their stuff out, all the cities are so afraid of losing tax money and what have you, it seems to be very-very difficult to get this going, so what is your strategy to battle the bureaucrats to push back, what are you going to do about the older truckers, I mean the transportation is 10% of GDP in the United States but I'm thinking about a self-driving car that will be all gone. You will lose about 8% of the employment in this affair. How do you see say anything about how you're going to do it. The other one is about AI.
Eric Schmidt
Can we go ahead and answer that question, who would like to answer that?
Sundar Pichai
You know in general, you know, we think about technology a bit differently as in most cases we do it to aid and improve the lives of people and I think that's true in self-driving cars too. Eric talked about the impact on lives but we if you look at the time people spend driving and the loss of productivity in an economy those are really important attributes as well. In terms of generally the regulatory environment you know, when I look at our track record we've been very-very successful in getting the products we need in the hands of users, and even in newer areas you know we have worked closely with the regulatory bodies to drive change and be it things like Google Fiber or self-driving cars we always believe in engaging and driving change in a positive way and I think we'll continue to do that.
Unidentified Analyst
But how about the employment in this business, if people don't own a car anymore, then 95% of cars are standing idle, if you get rid of all the stuff.
Eric Schmidt
I think in general we would say that the kind of questions you're asking are very difficult to future questions, but right now we want to get these cars in the hands of people who cannot drive them but have them driven and that's our highest priority, there're many-many benefits of that, you had a second question?
Unidentified Analyst
If you look at IBM it was beating the world chess champion in 1997 or so and as well is considered a big deal but it's from the perspective of theoretically AI, academic AI it had no impact it was really irrelevant. Now you claim the same thing about Go, again I think from academic pure deep AI it's irrelevant that I think you do.
Eric Schmidt
I strongly disagree with what you just said and I'll explain. The algorithms that were invented to power AlfaGo are generally known as reinforcement learning, and reinforcement learning is a new way of machine learning working. Traditional machine learning is a classifier where what you do is you sort of look at pictures and you say, that’s a cat, that's a dog and what have you. Reinforcement learning is where things change and you change the weights as you learn so it’s an experiential process, and it's much more like humans, and I think most people in the industry would say that the achievement of AlfaGo was to prove that reinforcement learning could work at a scale that was previously thought not applicable. There are many-many research developments and so forth to come but people today will say that reinforcement learning and in particular AlfaGo was historic from a computer science perspective.

Unidentified Analyst
Well I feel much more to say about it so excuse me.
Eric Schmidt
Okay, thank you very much, yes sir and you'll have, sir you have the last question in the back, yes sir.
Unidentified Analyst
Good morning, my name is Mel Ortner and I'm sure you're aware that Facebook and Microsoft are planning to lay a 4,000 mile cable between Virginia and Spain. I know I vaguely remember that Google at one time was involved in a project like this and off the top of my head I'm not in the business of education I don’t know technology very well, but in today's world the technology I'm just wondering how prudent it is for them to be doing something like this and what your opinion is of --.
Eric Schmidt
We should not comment on the activities of our competitors and partners. I can tell you that at the right time we funded in collaboration with other companies the construction of a very large network of cables which we now use through the Pacific and in the Atlantic and around the world and when you use Google, you are using the benefit of that infrastructure that was done some year ago. Okay thank you. Yes sir and you have the last question.
Unidentified Analyst
Hi. My name is Eric Sprague I'm a shareholder from the Sacramento area. I wanted to get your thoughts on share based compensation. I see it as a real expense that in some ways if it's too high can limit capital allocation because if you are always having to buy back shares to combat dilution on the other hand I think it's necessary to a certain degree to keep the best employees and to get a new employees that are the best. So I was wondering what your thoughts are on it, where you see it going as the company matures in the next 10 years in comparison to net income it's higher than at a company like Apple but it's a lot lower than lot of other companies in Silicon Valley. So I just want to get your thoughts.
Eric Schmidt
Ruth?
Ruth Porat
We've done a great job laying out all of the issues in the considerations. What we start with is talent is what drives the creation and innovation and returns that you've seen. And we want to make sure there is a really strong alignment of interest and then everyone here from day one has had a stake in the company that they are creating, and building and loving it. So that's a very important part of it. One of the things we have really moved to in the last year to your point is highlighting in every and all of the budgeting that we are doing that expense like pushing it down to the business leaders so they are looking at the overall expense of running the business as we are talking about resources and resource allocation. And so it is very much front of mind as we think about, what are the opportunities, what's the impact on the income statement but the most important thing is driving the alignment of interest we do believe that's very valuable.
Another part of your question was about cash and how are we using it and share repurchases and what we've done there and really the opportunity we had and we spent time with our board as to look at what are the requirements to continue to invest and grow the business, what are all the capital expenditure opportunities that we have, how do we think about investments again to continue to invest in all we’re doing in Google and across the other vets and that enabled us to announce the [indiscernible] 26 share repurchase program so there was an offset at by retiring shares which we've been doing since the fourth quarter of last year. And so we’re balancing all of the different objectives again with the lens to how do we continue to create shareholder value in the near, medium and the longer term.
Unidentified Analyst
Thank you.
Eric Schmidt
Laszlo has an important announcement.

Unidentified Company Representative
Well a question from the shareholder from [indiscernible] affected me deeply and so I went ahead and asked a colleague to go and pick up about 100 hats from our store and they should get delivered here in 5 or 10 minutes someone will be just outside the door on your way out.
Eric Schmidt
Let's just say that you could see why the usual suspects here we've got Ruth, David, Sundar and Lazlo me it is a privilege to work in Alphabet and Google is a life calling for me and I think for the rest of us I can assure you will be here next year and we really want you to be here too. Thank you very, very much.
