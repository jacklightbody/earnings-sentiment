Neal Mohan
Well done.
Ben Swinburne
We’re really exited to welcome back to the conference to my left Neal Mohan. Neal is Vice President of Display and Video Advertising Products or as I said everything other than search at Google. Neal is responsible for growing the company’s digital media solutions and advertising offerings on YouTube, the Google display network, AdSense, AdMob, and the DoubleClick platform, also serves on the Board of Directors of the Interactive Advertising Bureau and the Mobile Marketing Association. And Neal prior to joining Google was Senior VP of Strategy at DoubleClick before the acquisition and led the integration.
So Neal let me welcome you back to the conference. Thanks so much for being here.
Neal Mohan
Glad to be here, thanks for having me. 
Ben Swinburne
So let’s start big picture, one of the big debates on Google stock revolves around the ability to grow what is the significant revenue base at the kind of levels you’ve grown in the past and particularly going after brand advertising dollars. The conversation we’ve been having throughout the conference both with competitors and AMCs and another folks in the ecosystem. But walk us through how you see Google strategy and product offerings at a high level for those big brand advertisers and their agency partners?
Neal Mohan
Sure, so I mean if you think about not just Google, but the evolution of digital marketing, digital media over the course of the last sort of 10, 15, 20 years, predominantly it’s been monetized through performance advertising or direct response advertising and that’s been a great run for the entire ecosystem. But one of the big opportunities that many folks have heard me talk about this a lot in the past and it’s a big area of focus within the companies around sort of cracking the brand advertising, not just on behalf of Google, but for the entire ecosystem if you will. And for us that’s starts first and foremost of course with YouTube, which is our flagship video property, attracts over one billion users every single month, the amount of watch time on YouTube is growing 50% year-on-year and of course that translates into an incredibly attractive place for brand advertisers because brand advertisers like to tell stories sight, sound, and motion and video happens to be frankly the best medium for that. And so YouTube is really sort of front and center in terms of our areas of investment in terms of cracking the brand advertising that, one of the flagship formats that we have though which is our native advertising format is called TrueView. Many of you have seen it, it’s the skippable add format on YouTube.
The number of TrueView impressions on YouTube has actually grown nearly 75% year-on-year, so phenomenal uptake by advertisers, and agencies and brands over the course of the last year and it’s really the early stages there. So YouTube is a big part of that growth cracking the brand nut. 

The other area that I would call out which applies to Google and really to the entire ecosystem is delivering the means by which brand advertisers and their agency counterparts can measure the efficacy of digital campaign.
And what’s really been beautiful about our direct response and performance advertising in digital is that, you can measure it clicks, impressions, clicks and conversions. And so the challenge before all of us is can we do the same thing around brand, around brand advertising. And so that’s been a big area of focus for us around things like viewability and reach measurement, is my ad showing up to the right set of users and are they able to actually see it across the digital ecosystem, including YouTube.
We’re also investing in tools like Brand Lift, which give brand advertisers the ability to actually measure the impact of their brand campaigns, not just to show all the ads, but as a result of seeing them did it change their perception around my brand, did it change how they think about my new product or what have you. And we’ve run 6,000 of these studies, they’ve produced - they’ve shown great results in terms of advertisers running campaigns on YouTube. But more importantly we’re actually able to give those insights back to brands in real near time. And if you contrast that with how it works for brands on television, where they oftentimes get these insights, weeks, or months, or quarters after those campaigns are done, we can actually deliver those insights while their campaigns are running and allow them to deliver optimized results, as a result of it.
And so those are a couple of the big areas we’re focused on in terms of really cracking the brand nut, on behalf of Google and on behalf of the ecosystem.
Ben Swinburne
If we think about your conversation with agencies today, what’s different with what you’re offering from a products perspective versus say a year or two ago? Certainly when I thought to ad buyers there seems to be a real big evolution in how they think about YouTube and using YouTube for their clients.
Neal Mohan
Yes, I mean YouTube obviously as I described is really front and center in that conversation, it’s where their brands want to be, it’s where consumers are, in fact there was over 7 million hours’ worth of ad content. So these are online videos on YouTube that are actually made by brands, watched since the beginning of this year on YouTube. Last year, four of the top ten videos across all of YouTube, were actually built by brands, they were ads. And so it turns out to be a great place for brands to engage with their consumers, tell stories often times these ads are quite long, there was a Nike ad that was over five minutes long, so you can break out of the sort of standard 15 or 30 second mold that you stuck to on television. So that works incredibly well for agencies and brands.
I also touched on what we’re doing in terms of proving the efficacy of brand advertising on YouTube and digital in general and that’s an important conversation for agencies. The other piece that I’ll add to that or kind of two other pieces that I’ll call out are first and foremost, in all of my agency conversations, it’s pretty clear that agencies want to be able to enable this programmatically.
Ben Swinburne
Yes.
Neal Mohan
And programmatic buying is one of the fastest growing parts of not just our business, but the entire ecosystem if you will. For example, in Q4 last year, we saw growth in revenue in our DoubleClick Bid Manager platform grow 100% year-on-year, which is just phenomenal growth and DoubleClick Bid Manager happens to be the platform that’s used by many large agency on behalf of their brand clients to buy programmatically across the entire digital ecosystem.
So programmatic is the big part of the conversation. It’s an area where we continue to invest in heavily, we’ve been pioneers in this space as you know, and our investments there continues unabated. And then the other big area, of course outside of programmatic in the agency conversations, of course is how do we make sure that all of our tools and capabilities apply to the multi-screen world that our consumers who are already living in. Consumers live a 24/7 connected like we all do. There is a stat recently that 90% of consumers begin a task on one device and completed it on another.

From an advertiser and agency perspective, we need to be able to address that market reality and that’s a big area of focus for us. And it’s turning out to pay off in the numbers in fact, there has been 68% increase in the amount of mobile impressions across our entire stack year-on-year, which is I already mentioned the nearly 75% growth rate in Trueview impressions, but mobile also is a big driver.
So merging formats are a big driver of our entire programmatic stack, which tends to be again, where a lot of the conversation with our agency partners is focused.
Ben Swinburne
Is that 68% increase a YouTube statistic on mobile or across…
Neal Mohan
Across the entire stack.
Ben Swinburne
Okay. You mentioned measurement and attribution, so we had a session yesterday on programmatic with [indiscernible] an agency person and talked about some of the issues there around understanding measurement on the video side, generally TV, but also online. What are you seeing in the industry you’re on the board of IAB I know they are focused on it? What are the things we’re going to see in 2015 on the measurement front, either from Google or from the industry to really make a difference with agency trust and transparency?
Neal Mohan
Yes, I mean, I think, the way that I think about it is, this is a problem that needs to get solved at industry wide level. I think Google is in a position because of our DoubleClick stack and its adoption on both the publisher side and the advertiser side where our publisher partners and our advertiser and agency partners are often looking to us to help develop those solutions because we happen to operate the technology stacks that they use to manage their media buying or selling weather they are advertisers or publishers.
And so, the way I think about it is really as a pyramid if you will and from a brands perspective the very first question that every brand should be asking is, did a human being actually see my ad. And that sounds kind of like an obvious question and one that the answer should of course yes. But from a digital standpoint one of the biggest challenges we have that I believe is an addressable challenge is to answer the question of viewability for brands. And we have a product there called Active View, which we make available freely in our DoubleClick stack for advertisers and publishers to use to seamlessly measure viewability across their entire campaign. In January, I announced that we bought it not just to display in banners and rich media, but also to video and so it’s available for video advertising, as well as display.
But really that’s the bottom of the pyramid and after answering the question of whether a human being actually saw my ad, the next obvious question that a brand should ask is, was it the right set of human beings, did I reach my target audience?
And that’s where Google is partnered with companies like comScore and Nielsen around their VC and OCR metrics to be able to measure audience reach and frequency across YouTube but across our Google display network as well, across the entire DoubleClick stack to kind of - to broaden it out. And, if you think about sort of what brands had available in Television land, it really was sort of up to that question of did the right set of users see my ad, was it the right audience, using GRPs as a proxy for that.
But the beauty of digital is we can go one step further. And so, I think the next step in the pyramid above and beyond, did a human being see my ad and was it the right human being, is a question that really matter’s to brands, which is, what impact did it have, what did it change about that set of consumers that I reached as a result of me spending money in digital? And I think that that’s kind of Holy Grail, or the very key metric that needs to get solved, just like if you think about sort of clicks in AdWords, what that did for direct response and search campaigns and the fact that clicks were associated with some sort of conversion or sale event down the road.

And so, that next pyramid is sort of what we call our brand lift products, we have a portfolio of products that allow brands to be able to measure the impact of their campaign. As I mentioned, things like change in consideration, change in ad recall, change in brand awareness, all those upper funnel metrics that brands know and love, but really had no way of actually measuring in meaningful scale before the advent of these products in this brand lift portfolio. And again, these are products that we make available to our brands for free, we ran 6,000 of these studies as I mentioned last year. The good news is that places like YouTube actually do generate meaningful brand lift, but as I said, the really sort of healthy metric for us in the long-term is the fact that not only do these campaigns generate lift, but we can give that lift insight to brand back in as near real time as possible. And I think that’s the distinguishing thing about what happens in the digital world versus what brands have been used to in television, where they could never get those insights in real time and therefore could not optimize our campaigns while they were still running.
And so if you think about that from a brand’s perspective, that’s a difference between getting the exact results you are looking for during your holiday most important campaign time of the year, versus getting some result after the fact that you can only apply 12 months down the road when you are running your next holiday campaign.
And so it’s kind of a long answer to your question, but I wanted to unpack that a little bit and give some visibility into how we think about sort of our brand measurement strategy and how we think it’s going to be game changing in terms of really cracking that nut for brand advertisers, not just on YouTube, but across the entire digital ecosystem as we bake those metrics into our DoubleClick platforms as well.
Ben Swinburne
You’ve been at this for a while so you know that the debate around measurement and data is a fierce one. And certainly, one of the things that I think has helped television maintain inertia is you have Nielsen rating people understand it, it’s easy currency to trade, even if it’s not perfect. Where do you come down to sort of the first-party, third-party data point on your business, because you’ve mentioned Nielsen OCR and VCE that’s helped, are you all the way there now in terms of using a third-party currency to help brand advertisers that maybe more important their agency partners believe in what they are buying and sort of comfortable putting more money to work or is there more room to go?
Neal Mohan
So as I said at the beginning our goal is to partner with the entire industry like you said, I’m on the Board of the IAB, these are all big issues there. And I think they need to get addressed from an industry stand point. Having said that, I believe that the industry does look to companies like Google to actually help address a lot of the technological challenges on behalf of the industry. And so I mentioned our viewability product called Active View. So that’s a technology that we’ve developed. It has without getting into a lot of the gory technical detail, has the capability to provide broad coverage in terms of viewability for publishers and advertisers, but we believe that that’s something that shouldn’t just remain the purview of Google and that’s why we’ve made it available for free across our entire stack, it’s MRC accredited and we’re happy for it to be something that’s used by the entire industry. And so we view our role as really contributors of insights in technology that can be adopted by a broader industry but absolutely needs to be an industry wide effort as opposed to siloed metrics developed by individual players.

Ben Swinburne
Let’s turn now to the content strategy equation, but stick on this theme of agency and brand advertiser adoption of YouTube. Is your perspective on what kind of content you want to put on YouTube and what you want to pay for evolving; you’ve launched YouTube Kids recently, which at least as a parent seems to be an evolution and a little bit of a different direction, but maybe you can put that into context for us and how you’re thinking about evolving the content piece of the puzzle at YouTube. 
Neal Mohan
Yes, I mean, for us it’s always been about really from the early days of YouTube, it’s really been about the organic evolution of a lot of that content. I mean if you think about some of the largest creators on YouTube today, PewDiePie, Bethany Mota, et cetera. Those are incredibly fierce loyal fan bases that they’ve built up and they’re very large. And so at YouTube we view our job as really sort of supporting our creators through that entire sort of lifecycle. And that includes everything from studio support. So we have studios in LA and New York where we help creators marketing support, you’ve seen our kind of YouTube originals marketing efforts.
And then back in September, we announced also monetary support around some types of programming. And really it’s oriented around our creators and the breadth of our creators is pretty astonishing. YouTube today has more 18 to 34 years olds and any cable channel out there, I already mentioned the watch time growth 50% year-over-year and so really the goal there is to support creators in anyway possible. Few weeks ago we mentioned that the amount of money that we paid out to creators grew by about 50% between 2013 and 2014 and so it’s an incredibly vibrant platform, we view it as – we’ve always viewed it as three pillars, our users, our viewers, our creators, the people that are publishing the content and then of course our advertisers, who are looking to these consumers, but then are also helping support that content.
Ben Swinburne
The advent of the YouTube stars been impressive to watch you mentioned some of the big stars, are you seeing real competition for talent now in a business that you essentially created in many ways, because we’ve seen some new companies launched recently. And even some other online incumbents look at trying to build the business like YouTube which is easier said than done, but it couldn’t in dearly [ph] pressure your margins.
Neal Mohan
I mean we’re heads-down, focused on supporting our consumers. I mean supporting our creators and what they care about and what they tell us anytime I’ve met with them, what they share back, with me is YouTube is a place where their audience is, that’s where they are able to connect with their audience. In fact the conversation very quickly moves to the types of features and capabilities we could provide to creators to help them better connect with their audience. And so, our creators at least in my conversation remain incredibly committed to the platform. They know that’s where their users are. I mentioned some of the results we’ve been able to provide from a monetization standpoint.
So we are incredibly happy with that. We’re always looking for ways to deepen that partnership with creators it’s an incredibly vibrant creative community. And so, making sure that it remains that way is kind of one of the fundamental tenants of YouTube.
Ben Swinburne
Let’s pivot into the programmatic automation side of the equation, your background in DoubleClick of course make sense to talk about this topic, it’s a big one. I think probably one maybe people don’t understand as much as we all would like to, what’s your perspective on the change that’s happening, seems like its accelerating in terms of pace on how media has bought and what that means to your broader display [indiscernible] in particular.

Neal Mohan
Yes, I mean so one other things that I would say is, I think, everybody and probably a few people in this room, as well have this impression and programmatic as being the place where run an inventory a transacted primarily for a direct response objective. And if you go back to a kind of several years ago, that is where a lot of the kind of early momentum for programmatic really came from.
But what's most exciting to me about the space is how much it is now apply to kind of the entire spectrum of inventory and advertiser used cases. In fact, last year, we launched a program called Google Partner Select. And it was a program meant to be complementary to our YouTube offering, but specifically the YouTube sort of the Google preferred offering, which is kind of the premium sort of 5% of YouTube. And Partner Select has turned out to be a collection of the Internet sort of most premium video partners on one end and the most premium sort of global brands on the other end. Recently a few weeks ago, we announced sort of 50% partners on the sell side and the by side. And its fundamentally a programmatic video marketplace that transacts premium programmatic – premium video inventory sort of the cream of the crop in terms of what brands are looking for, but does though programmatically which is the other thing that brands are looking for and its growing on an impression basis 35%, month-on-month.
So phenomenal growth and it really just proves out the point in terms of the future of programmatic and where I see that being it, see it firmly sort of in the brand sort of programmatic premium spectrum of the market, which is incredibly exciting, because that’s a hugely sort of untapped opportunity for the growth of programmatic. If you think about sort of the amount of transactions that occur across the digital world, across the web, across the mobile, et cetera, about 70% of that media still transacted in a kind of upfront RSP manner the way you know television buying and selling happened.
And that’s always from movements to programmatic with the advent of things like private exchanges, programmatic deals, et cetera. And these are all areas where we’ve seen a phenomenal growth. You know I gave you some stats around Partner Select, but we’ve seen tremendous amount of growth in programmatic primarily in this programmatic premium section where CPMs tend to be higher with the types of brands tend to be the typical sort of the global premium brands that you would associate.
And so that’s where we see the future of programmatic heading it’s the reason why such a capability that so front and center for all of our agency and agency holding company conversations, as well.
Ben Swinburne
I can see why that trend would be a positive for DoubleClick and it’s business, does this trend help YouTube and broader Google in terms of its financial results?
Neal Mohan
Absolutely, I mean one of the means by which our agencies and advertisers would like to buy YouTube is programmatically as well, and I don’t have anything to announce there specifically today, but we recognize that that’s something that our advertisers and agencies have moved their business on to and obviously been leaders in that respect. But the YouTube turns out to be – happens to be the largest DoubleClick publisher out there. And so it’s already integrated in the DoubleClick publishers stack, if you will it’s a DFP publisher.
Ben Swinburne
Yes, it does seem like the momentum has been on the buyer side, but now publishers seem to be getting on the Board, what has happened in the last maybe within in this six months to 12 months, its convinced publishers you mentioned premium video to say, this is not erased to the bottom on pricing, this is actually core to growing my business, what’s happened?

Neal Mohan
I think its two things. And I think for me, at least it’s been two pieces, that have been fundamental to the programmatic equation since the early days. So first is, first and foremost from our publisher standpoint is it’s about yield. Programmatic buying, because it allows the application of all this very rich buy side data and inside to publishers inventory, that publishers may otherwise not have had access to generate higher yields for publishers in a way that’s more efficient because they can handle it through an automated pipeline supposed to the traditional way of buying and selling. And so more money of course is kind of – helps the story for sure.
The second is control. So publishers have control over the type of the inventory that they make available, how they make that available, how they manage channel conflict. For example, they might want to offer a slice of inventory to one particular agency in a way that might be different than the way that they do business with another agency or brand. And through the evolution of programmatic technology, they now have all those controls and all those bells and whistles. And so I think those would be the two things that have led to a very rapid adoption of kind of the programmatic capability on the sell side, not just on the by side.
Ben Swinburne
Yes, does any of your comments on what we are seeing in programmatic benefits to Google change in a mobile world versus desktop or it’s essentially the same story?
Neal Mohan
There is of course changes in the underlying – some of the underlying technology. Obviously users tend to be in a different context, on mobile devices and they maybe on their desktop or tablets if you will. But I think fundamentally nothing has changed, it’s still about reaching consumers in the moments that truly matter. And if you think about it, that’s what Google has been about since the earliest days of its advertising business and that remains true to programmatic, it remains true as the world shifts to mobile. I mentioned one of the fastest growing parts of our entire stack, the programmatic stack, YouTube, or ad network, et cetera happens to be mobile where impressions are growing 68% year-on-year.
And so that has to do with the change of course in consumer behavior but the fact that the capabilities that we have are to advertisers and publishers keep up with that as well.
Ben Swinburne
Yes, we’re almost out of time, but I want to comeback and maybe end within another big debate on your stock and on your company which is how well positioned Google is in the mobile world. Talk about AdMob and particularly in-app advertising and then may be you can comment on the sort of the debate around the cookie list mobile environment that everyone’s navigating on the advertising and whether that’s an issue for Google?
Neal Mohan
Sure. Our AdMob business is one that we are incredibly happy with we’ve got over 650,000 app developers in growing and so it’s a quite a large network reaches a lot of billion users globally still from an advertiser and agency and brand perspective. It tends to be placed where they gravitate towards in terms of reaching our consumers and whether that used CASE of brand used CASE, whether it’s a performance used CASE, around app installed or app re-engagement, AdMob happens to be a place that works incredibly well for brands and we continue to invest and innovate there.
A couple days ago at the Game Developer Conference right here, we announced a couple of things, for example, app install ads in our Play Store, but also the ad went as Native Ad Format, support across our entire network. And so that’s something that our advertisers have been extremely excited about. And it’s been something that I think is going to work incredibly well for our developers as well, and it’s a big technical feet to be able to bring a truly native format to as heterogeneous of a network as we have.

Ben Swinburne
Yes.
Neal Mohan
But our fundamental goal on mobile is the same as it’s always been which is again reaching consumers in moment that really that matter to them. The beauty of our ad network and our properties like YouTube and others is that we are able to find users in a whole number of context. Whether there are entertaining themselves, through the video, socializing with friends, reading new sites, et cetera, searching for information, and so be able to find users in all kids of context throughout their day, is an incredibly powerful offering for advertisers and brand. And so we are extremely excited by our prospects.
To the second part of your question around sort of cookie list, I think that’s around sort of things like cross device measurement, et cetera. Those are capabilities that we continue to invest in. Few months ago, we announced our estimated total conversions in ad words as a means of being able to give a picture of total, our conversion activity driven by Google campaigns across all devices, that’s the capability that you could imagine extend to our entire stack even beyond AdWords. And for us, our advertising has always been about like I said, reaching consumers at the time that impact can be most powerful, whether it’s through the programmatic channel, whether it’s through our AdWords offering, or what have you and that applies just as much in the mobile context as [indiscernible].
Ben Swinburne
Thanks.
Neal Mohan
Well, thank you for sharing with us. Great conversation, we look forward to keeping up and chatting next here.
Ben Swinburne
Great thank you very much.
Neal Mohan
Thank you everybody, thank you.
Ben Swinburne
Thank you everybody.
